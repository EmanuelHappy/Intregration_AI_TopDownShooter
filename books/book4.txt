        FADE IN:

        EXT. HADES - DUSK

        We are MOVING TOWARD the Tyrell Corporation across a
        vast plain of industrialization, menacing shapes on the
        horizon, stacks belching flames five hundred feet into
        the sky the color of cigar ash.  The CAMERA MOVES INTO
        a window in the large pyramid-shaped building.  A man
        is sitting at a table.  Another man enters the room and
        sits down.  The following scene is reflected in the eye
        until HOLDEN is seated.


        INT. TYRELL CORPORATION INTERROGATION ROOM - DUSK

        The eye is magnified and deeply revealed.  Flecks of
        green and yellow in a field of milky blue.  Icy fila-
        ments surround the undulating center.

        The eye is brown in a tiny screen.  On the metallic
        surface below, the words VOIGHT-KAMPFF are finely
        etched.  There's a touch-light panel across the top
        and on the side of the screen, a dial that registers
        fluctuation of the iris.

        The instrument is no bigger than a music box and sits
        on a table between two men.  The man talking is big,
        looks like an overstuffed kid.  LEON it says on his
        breast pocket.  He's dressed in a warehouseman's uni-
        form and his pudgy hands are folded expectantly in his
        lap.  Despite the obvious heat, he looks very cool.

        The man facing him is lean, hollow-cheeked, and dressed
        in grey.  Detached and efficient, he looks like a cop
        or an accountant.  His name is Holden and he's all
        business, except for the sweat on his face.

        The room is large and humid.  Rows of salvaged junk
        are stacked neatly against the walls.  Two large FANS
        WHIRR above their heads.

                                LEON
                  Okay if I talk?

        Holden doesn't answer.  He's centering Leon's eye on
        the machine.

                                LEON
                  I kinda get nervous when I take
                  tests.

                                HOLDEN
                  Don't move.

                                LEON
                  Sorry.

        He tries not to move, but finally his lips can't help
        a sheepish smile.

                                LEON
                  I already had I.Q. test this year...
                  but I don't think I never had a...

                                HOLDEN
                  Reaction time is a factor in this so
                  please pay attention. Answer as quickly
                  as you can.

                                LEON
                  Uh... sure...

                                HOLDEN
                  One one eight seven at Hunterwasser...

                                LEON
                  Oh... that's the hotel.

                                HOLDEN
                  What?

                                LEON
                  Where I live.

                                HOLDEN
                  Nice place ?

                                LEON
                  Huh? Sure.  Yeah. I guess. Is
                  that.. part of the test ?

       Holden smiles a patronising smile.

                                HOLDEN
                  Warming you up, that's all.

                                LEON
                  Oh.
                  It's

                                HOLDEN
                  You're in a desert, walking along
                  in the sand when....

                                LEON
                  Is this the test now ?

                                HOLDEN
                  Yes.   You're in a desert, walking
                  along in the sand when all of a sudden
                  you lookdown and see a.....

                                LEON
                  What one ?

   It was a timid interruption, hardly audible.

                                HOLDEN
                  What ?

                                LEON
                  What desert ?

                                HOLDEN
                  Doesn't make any difference what
                  desert.. it's completely hypothetical.

                                LEON
                  But how come I'd be there?

                                HOLDEN
                  Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want
                  to be by yourself.. who knows.
                  So you look down and see a 
                  tortoise.  It's crawling toward
                  you....

                                LEON
                  A tortoise.  What's that?

                                HOLDEN
                  Know what a turtle is?

                                LEON
                  Of course.

                                HOLDEN
                  Same thing.

                                LEON
                  I never seen a turtle.

        He sees Holden's patience is wearing thin.

                                LEON
                  But I understand what you mean.

                                HOLDEN
                  You reach down and flip the
                  tortoise over on its back, Leon.

        Keeping an eye on his subject, Holden notes the dials
        in the Voight-Kampff.  One of the needles quivers
        slightly.

                                LEON
                  You make these questions, Mr.
                  Holden, or they write 'em down
                  for you?

        Disregarding the question, Holden continues, picking
        up the pace.

                                HOLDEN
                  The tortoise lays on its back,
                  its belly baking in the hot sun,
                  beating its legs trying to turn
                  itself over.  But it can't.  Not
                  without your help.  But you're not
                  helping.

        Leon's upper lip is quivering.

                                LEON
                  Whatya mean, I'm not helping?

                                HOLDEN
                  I mean you're not helping!  Why is
                  that, Leon?

        Holden looks hard at Leon, piercing look.

        Leon is flushed with anger, breathing hard, it's a
        bad moment, he might erupt.

        Suddenly Holden grins disarmingly.

                                HOLDEN
                  They're just questions, Leon.
                  In answer to your query, they're
                  written down for me.  It's a 
                  test, designed to provoke an
                  emotional response.

        Leon is glaring now, the blush subsides, his anger
        slightly defused.

        Holden smiles cheerfully, very smooth.

                                HOLDEN
                  Shall we continue?

        Leon nods, still frowning, suspiciously.

                                HOLDEN
                  Describe in single words.  Only
                  the good things that come into
                  your mind.  About your mother.

                                LEON
                  My...

        Leon looks shocked, surprised.  But the needles in
        the computer barely move.  Holden goes for the in-
        side of his coat.  But big Leon is faster.  His
        laser burns a hole the size of a nickel through
        Holden's stomach.  Unlike a bullet, a laser causes
        no impact.  It goes through Holden's shoulder and
        comes out his back, clean as a whistle.  Like a
        rag doll he falls back into the seat.  Big slow Leon
        is already walking away, but he stops, turns, and
        with a little smile of satisfaction fires through
        the back of the seat.

        As Leon walks out of the room the Voight-Kampff
        begins to blink, faint but steady.

                                                   CUT TO:


        EXT. OVERHEAD VIEW CITY - NIGHT

        We are looking down on a city of the future where
        gigantic buildings dwarf the ancient skyscrapers --
        of -- now as a huge blimp, flashing lights and
        BLARING SOUND drifts slowly over the tall buildings.

        EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

        Lights from the blimp flash along the street and wipe
        across the crowds of pedestrians as the VOICE TRACK
        CONTINUES TO BLARE from above.

        A portable noodle bar is crowded with customers, sit-
        ting on stools slurping their food out of bowls.

        DECKARD is standing near the noodle bar waiting for a
        seat.  He's in his thirties, wiry, athletic, rumpled,
        used, unshaven.  He's holding a newspaper, made of
        tissue paper, open while he glances at the blimp
        passing NOISILY overhead.  Then he notices the
        COUNTERMAN.

        The Counterman is beckoning to him to a newly vacated
        seat.

        Deckard sits down at the noodle bar and the Counterman,
        an elderly Japanese, slaps a menu in front of him.

        No words on the menu, just pictures of sliced fish
        parts.

        Deckard points to a particular item and holds up four
        fingers.

        The Counterman looks at the item on the menu, confirms
        the order by holding up two fingers.

        Deckard shakes his head "no" and repeats his four
        fingers.

        The Counterman nods, corrected and hurries off.

        Deckard glances overhead.

        The blimp drifts off among the buildings like a fish
        disappearing in seaweed, the NOISY VOICE doing a
        diminuendo.

        Whap.  The Counterman slaps a bowl of rice and a pot
        of tea in front of Deckard.  Then he puts the little
        bowl with the two slices of fish on the counter.

        Deckard looks at the fish.  Two slices of fish.

        He looks at the Counterman and holds up four fingers.

        The Counterman looks down at the two slices of fish,
        looks like two to him.  He looks at Deckard as though
        Deckard was a fool and holds up two fingers.  He can
        count!

        Deckard stares bleakly at the fish.  Can't win.

        He starts to eat and that's when he feels a tap on his
        shoulder.  He glances over his right shoulder.

        A huge cop in uniform is looming behind him.

        Deckard feels funny, looks left.

        Another cop is looming over his left shoulder.

        Deckard is tapped again from the right.

        Turning again he realizes that it isn't the cop tapping
        him, it's the short Japanese guy next to the cop.  The
        guy's got beady eyes and lots of energy.  His name is
        GAFF.

                                GAFF
                         (in Japanese)
                  *** You will be required to
                  accompany me, sir. ***

        Deckard doesn't understand Japanese, thinks the man
        wants a seat.

                                DECKARD
                  Wait your turn, pal.

        Deckard turns back to his food.

                                GAFF
                         (in Japanese)

                  official request, I will be
                  obliged to exert my authority. ***

        Deckard is ignoring Gaff but the Counterman leans in
        Deckard's face and translates.

                                THE COUNTERMAN
                  He say, you go with him.

        Deckard turns and finds Gaff waving a badge in his face.

                                GAFF
                         (in Japanese)

        Deckard doesn't understand a word.

                                THE COUNTERMAN
                  He say, you're under arrest, Deckard.

        Deckard turns back to his food.

                                DECKARD
                  Tell him he's got the wrong guy.
                         (turning to Gaff
                          loudly)
                  You got the wrong guy, pal.

                                GAFF

                                THE COUNTERMAN
                  He say, Boogeyman.

        Deckard flinches at the word "Boogeyman," but goes on
        eating.  But now we know, and he knows it's not a
        mistake.

                                THE COUNTERMAN
                  He say, Brade Runner.  He say,
                  Mister Nightime.

                                DECKARD
                  Tell him I'm eating.

                                GAFF
                         (to the Counterman

                  even if I have to serve him like
                  so much sushi. ***

        Deckard is continuing to eat but he has reacted to
        Gaff's repeated use of the word "Bryant."

                                THE COUNTERMAN
                         (to Deckard)
                  He say, you be ornery, okay.  He
                  say big boss Bryant give him
                  permission to use violence make
                  arrest.  He say Bryant tell him
                  rearrange your brains akay.  Make
                  you raw fish.

        Deckard looks disgusted and resigned.

                                DECKARD
                  Bryant huh.

        EXT. STREET - NIGHT

        Deckard, still holding his bowl of food, is climbing
        into a spinner behind Gaff as the two cops loom over
        him.  One of the cops shuts the spinner door behind
        Deckard and the spinner lifts off in a flurry of wind.

                                                   CUT TO:


        EXT. CITY - BIRD'S EYE VIEW - NIGHT

        The spinner zips through the canyons of the city.

        Deckard is sitting in the passenger seat, eating while
        he watches the maze of suspension bridges, platforms
        and catwalks swim by below.  The tops of larger build-
        ings emblazoned with fluorescent numerals and scrawls
        of neon ads.

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. SPINNER - NIGHT

        Deckard is sitting gloomily in the passenger seat,
        still eating from his bowl with chopsticks as Gaff
        maneuvers the spinner through the city canyons chat-
        tering in rapid Japanese.

                                GAFF
                         (in Japanese)
                  I told Bryant I could take care of
                  this myself.  Just move me up.
                  I'll do the job, I told him.  Five
                  phonies.  I just air 'em out.
                         (he imitates shooting)
                  Bow!  Bow!  Bow!

        Deckard looks at Gaff uncomprehendingly.

                                GAFF
                          (continuing in Japanese)
                  But no, he says.  Bryant thinks
                  you're hot shit, smartest spotter,
                  baddest Blade Runner.  You don't
                  look so hot to me.  Don't even
                  shave.  Bad grooming reflects on
                  the whole department.  You don't
                  dress well, that reflects on me...
                  makes the whole department look
                  like shit.
                  The skin jobs look better than you
                  do!  What's the point of wiping out
                  skin jobs if they look better than
                  Enforcement?  pretty soon the public
                  will want skin jobs for Enforcement.
                  I guess you'd prefer that, hunh?
                  That why you quit?

        Deckard looks at Gaff.  He hasn't understood a word.

                                DECKARD
                  I don't understand a word you're
                  saying.

        Gaff glares and mutters, turning his attention to navi-
        gation of the spinner.

                                GAFF
                         (in Japanese)
                  Exactly!  Whatta jerk!  If I wasn't
                  up for promotion I'd put this baby
                  in a hot spin and leave your dinner
                  all over the glass!

        The spinner flies low along the center of a busy
        street and then turns right.


        EXT. PRECINCT SPINNER PAD - NIGHT

        The spinner slides toward the pad, cuts speed and
        gently touches down as another lifts off.

        INT. POLICE HQ CONCOURSE - NIGHT

        An enormous grey vault of a building, Deckard and Gaff
        stride down the long corridor.  Perhaps Gaff is still
        jabbering in Japanese.

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. BRYANT'S OFFICE - NIGHT

        BRYANT is sitting behind his big desk, a fat man in his
        fifties with grey hair, jowls and gas.

                                BRYANT
                  Hiya, Deck!

        Deckard is standing in the doorway, still in the cus-
        tody of Gaff.  Deckard glares at Bryant and doesn't
        answer.  Bryant dismisses Gaff with a head movement.
        Deckard glares at Gaff who glares back as he departs.

                                BRYANT
                  You wouldn't have come if I'd just
                  asked you to.  Siddown, pal.

        Deckard glares at Bryant without moving.

                                BRYANT
                  Don't be an asshole, Deckard.  I
                  got five skin jobs walking the
                  streets.

        Deckard smiles and sits down.

                                BRYANT
                  They jumped a shuttle offworld.
                  Killed the crew and passengers.

        Deckard reacts.  This isn't usual.

                                BRYANT
                  We found the shuttle floating off
                  the coast two weeks ago.  So we
                  know they're around.

                                DECKARD
                  Embarrassing.

        Bryant is pouring bourbon into a thick shot glass.  He
        passes the amber tumbler to Deckard who takes it and
        holds it to the light.

                                BRYANT
                  No, sir!  Not fucking embarrassing
                  ... Because nobody's ever gonna
                  find out they're down here because
                  you're gonna spot 'em an' you're
                  gonna air 'em out.

        Deckard downs his drink and slides the empty back.

                                DECKARD
                  Not me, Bryant.  I won't work for
                  you anymore.  Give it to Holden,
                  he's good.

        Deckard turns to go.

                                BRYANT
                  I did.

        Deckard freezes and turns back.

                                DECKARD
                  And?

                                BRYANT
                  He can breathe okay... as long as
                  nobody unplugs him.

        Deckard is impressed.

                                BRYANT
                         Not good enough.  Not as
                  good as you.  I need ya, Deck.
                  This is a bad one, the worst yet.
                  I need the old Blade Runner, I
                  need your magic.

        Deckard meets Bryant's pleading eyes for a beat.

                                DECKARD
                  I was quit when I walked in
                  here...
                         (pause)
                  ... I'm twice as quit now.
                  See ya, Bryant.

        Deckard turns to go.

        Bryant's pleading look turns abruptly cold and hard.

                                BRYANT
                  Stop the fuck right where you are!

        Deckard freezes at the hard tone.

                                BRYANT
                  You know the score, pal.  When
                  you're not a cop, you're little
                  people.

                                DECKARD
                  Forgot there for a minute about
                  the little people.  No choices
                  I guess.

                                BRYANT
                  No choice, pal.

                                                   CUT TO

        INT. WHITE TILED ROOM (DAY)

        We are looking at the bright image of a NAKED MAN in a
        white tiled room with a white floor... an abbatoir
        without blood. The naked man is very athletic. His
        face reveals nothing as he executes one physical demon-
        stration after another.... one handed pushups, gymnastic
        contortions etc. An accompanying soundtrack drones
        boringly and while we might pick up a few key words
        such as "emigration, "incentive and "Man made
        that we absorb the words.. they are the music to which
        the image exercises.

        After a moment a series of lines cross the screen and
        the image diminishes and we realise we are looking at
        a monitor.


        INT. BRYANT'S OFFICE (DAY)

        Deckard and Bryant are sitting in the dark looking
        at a series of flickering monitors. Deckard has a
        bored expression on his face.

                                BRYANT
                  We had an escape from the Off world
                  colonies two weeks ago. Six repli-
                  cants, three male, three female.
                  Slaughtered twenty three people and
                  jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol
                  found the ship in the desert. No
                  crew.

                                DECKARD
                  These are old slave tapes, show me
                  something new.

        The naked man continues to exercise as Bryant
        continues.

                                BRYANT
                  No sign of them then three nights ago
                  they tried to break into the Tyrell
                  Corporation, one got fried going through
                  an electro-field but we lost the others.
                  Going on the possibibility they might
                  try to infiltrate as employees, we sent
                  Holden in to run Voight Kampff tests on
                  new workers.  Guess he found himself one.

        The screen changes. Roy Batty in a loin cloth is battering
        a metal post with his fists.  The smile on his face
        indicates a total lack of pain.  He continues to pummel
        the post mercilessly his hands becoming bloody.
        The only sound is Batty humming Beethoven's 9th.

        Deckard begins to look interested.

                                DECKARD
                  Who's this ?

                                BRYANT
                  It's a Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept
                  date 2016, combat model optimum self
                  sufficiency. Probably the leader.

                                DECKARD
                  Why would they come down here ?
                  They coulda hid out ?

                                BRYANT
                  You tell me pal, that's what you're
                  here for.

                                DECKARD
                  They must want something pretty important
                  to risk coming back here. What do the
                  rest look like ?

        Bryant pushes a button. And a series of revolving still
        shots of Leon, Pris, Mary and Zhora appear on the screen.

                                DECKARD
                  Why the Tyrell Corporation? Why would
                  they return to the place of their
                  manufacture?

                                BRYANT
                  Maybe they want to find out when
                  they were made ?

                                DECKARD
                  Why would they bother?

                                BRYANT
                  The Nexus 6 was designed to copy human
                  beings in every way except their emotions.
                  But the makers reckoned that after a few
                  years they might develop their own
                  emotional responses - hate, love, fear,
                  anger, envy.  So they built in
                  a fail safe device.

                                DECKARD
                  What's that?

                                BRYANT
                  The Nexus 6 has only four years
                  to live.

        The screens go blank. The lights go on.  Bryant pours
        two more drinks and hands one to Deckard.

                                BRYANT
                  You got one more problem, pal.

        Deckard downs the glass.

                                BRYANT (continuing)
                  Looks like Holden found out that
                  V-K machine doesn't work on the Nexus
                  6. The Tyrell Corporation has a demo
                  model so go check it out.   If the
                  machine fails, we're in deep trouble.

        INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

        Small green letterforms skim soundlessly across a dark
        glass panel.  Beneath the panel a sick, white face
        reads excerpts from Treasure Island, mouthing the
        words as they appear in front of him.  It's Holden.

                                HOLDEN
                         (reading)

        Holden is flat on his back in a breather, an iron-
        lung-type of device covered in indicator lights and
        exotic paraphernalia.  The hospital room is in com-
        plete darkness.  Holden's breaths come in sharp rasps
        as he reads.

        We become aware of Deckard standing in the shadows.

                                DECKARD
                  Whatcha reading?

        Holden is startled, has to look in a mirror angled over
        his head, rolling his eyes way back to see who it is.

                                HOLDEN
                  Deckard, Treasure Island!  Good to
                  see ya, buddy.  Old Favourite.

        Deckard looks down at Holden and doesn't say anything.

                                HOLDEN
                  Pretty awful, huh?

                                DECKARD
                  Naw, you look great!  Absolutely
                  terrific!  Never saw ya look
                  better.  Jesus, you look good.

        Deckard pinches Holden's cheek.

                                DECKARD
                  Great complexion!  Suit looks
                  really nice.  Who's your tailor?

        Deckard is making a joke, mocking hospital good cheer
        but the touch of bitterness in his voice reveals his
        sympathy for Holden.

        Tears wet Holden's eyes.

                                HOLDEN
                  A big fucking skin job put the
                  smash on me, wrecked me up!  Looka
                  me, for Chrissake!

        Deckard works at being hard.

                                 DECKARD
                  Ya blew it, huh ?

        Holden recovers from his tears and whines.

                                 HOLDEN
                  It ain't like it used to be, Deck.
                  It's tough now. These replicants
                  aren't just a buncha muscle miners
                  anymore, they're no goddamn different
                  than you or me...

        Deckard lights up and sits down, resting his elbows on
        the glass.

                                 DECKARD
                  So what happened ?

                                 HOLDEN
                  Ten days ago Security at the
                  Tyrell Corp finds three intruders
                  in the records room.   Kills one,
                  two get away, okay ?

        Deckard nods.

                                 HOLDEN
                  They do a routine autopsy on the
                  one that got aired and.. whaddya know?
                  A skin job, one of the ones that
                  busted out!  Top drawer replicant..
                  combat type.. Nexus six.

                                 DECKARD
                  Pretty sexy, the sixes.

                                 HOLDEN
                  Sexy!  Three hours into the autopsy
                  they still think they're cutting
                  up a human.  No marks, nothing.

        Deckard looks impressed. Satisfied, Holden continues.

                                  HOLDEN
                  I decided to check out all new employees
                  at Tyrell. I test 26 boring jerks until
                  in comes this guy Leon Somebody, nothing
                  special but very big...
                             (pause)
                  Anyway....

                                  DECKARD
                  You Voight-Kampff him ?

        Holden's eyes flutter a moment.  Deckard waits.  The
        breathing changes rhythm.

                                  HOLDEN
                  Yeah!  I thought maybe I was getting
                  something......
                  Maybe it doesn't work on these ones
                  Deck.

        Deckard gets up and gives Holden phony good cheer.

                                  HOLDEN
                             (continuing)
                  It's all over, it's a wipe out,
                  they're almost us, Deck, they're
                  a disease, they're....

                                  DECKARD
                  Take it easy, take it easy....
                  Tyrell Corp's got one. I'm gonna
                  Vee Kay it tomorrow.

                                  HOLDEN
                  Push it!  Push that button!

        Deckard pushes.

                                  DECKARD
                  What's it for?

        INT. SPINNER - MORNING

        Deckard looks very rumpled as he sits sleepily in the
        passenger seat drinking coffee from a mug and smoking.


        INT. SPINNER - MORNING

        Gaff is terse and silent at the controls.  Suddenly the
        spinner rocks urgently from side to side and the sound
        of a hot Ferrari Spinner dopplers off.

        Gaff is pop-eyed with instant fury.  He hits the spinner
        lights and flashes them.

        The Ferrari Spinner zips right around a huge smokestack

        Gaff sputters and fumes as he guides the spinner around
        the same stack.

        Deckard looks at Gaff.  It's too early in the morning
        for all this energy.

        of belching flames five hundred feet into the sky the

        Now we see for the first time, Rachael, a beautiful
        woman in her late twenties dressed with taste and
        dignity.

                                DECKARD
                  Replicants are like any other
                  machine. They can be a benefit
                  or a hazard. If it's a benefit,
                  it's not my problem.

                                RACHAEL
                  May I ask a personal question?

                                DECKARD
                  Go ahead.

                                RACHAEL
                  Have you ever retired a human by
                  mistake ?

        Deckard blinks... hesitates before answering the
        question.

                                DECKARD
                  No.

                                RACHAEL
                  But in your position that is a risk.

        An OWL flaps around the huge marble office.

                                TYRELL (os)
                  Is this to be an empathy test?
                  Capillary dilation of the so-called

                  We call it Voight Kampff for short.

        Deckard turns to see an older man, very distinguished
        very well tailored has entered the huge marble office.
        TYRELL!

                                RACHAEL
                  Mr. Deckard.  Dr. Eldon Tyrell.

        Tyrell has extended his hand to Deckard. Deckard shakes.

                                TYRELL
                  Demonstrate it. I want to see it
                  work.

                                DECKARD
                  Where's the prototype ?

                                TYRELL
                  I want to see it work on a person.
                  I want to see a negative before I
                  provide you with a positive.

                                DECKARD
                  What's that gonna prove?

                                TYRELL
                  Indulge me.

                                DECKARD
                  On you?

        Tyrell indicates Rachael.

                                TYRELL
                  Try her.

        Deckard looks at Rachael.  She's a beauty alright.  He
        shrugs.

                                DECKARD
                  It's too bright in here.

        Tyrell hits a button.

        The windows darken, a polaroid effect that seems to
        give Tyrell the power to turn off the sun.

        Deckard is placing the Voight Kampff case on the table.

        The Voight Kampff opens like a butterfly as the room
        darkens.


        INT. TYRELL'S OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER

        Rachael's eye fills the screen, the iris brilliant,
        shot with light, the pupil contracting.  We hear
        Deckard's voice and we have the impression the test
        has been going on for a while.

                                DECKARD (O.S.)
                  You are given a calfskin wallet
                  for your birthday...

        Tyrell stands silhouetted behind Deckard, who sits in
        front of Rachael.

        The needles in both gauges swing violently past green
        to red, then subside.

                                RACHAEL
                  I wouldn't accept it, also I'd
                  report the person who gave it to me
                  to the police.

                                DECKARD
                  You have a little boy.  He shows
                  you his butterfly collection, plus
                  the killing jar.

        Again the gauges register, but not so far.

                                RACHAEL
                  I'd take him to the doctor.

                                DECKARD
                  You're watching TV and suddenly
                  you notice a wasp crawling on
                  your wrist.

                                RACHAEL
                  I'd kill it.

        Both needles go red.  Deckard makes a note, takes a
        sip of coffee and continues.

                                DECKARD
                  In a magazine you come across a
                  full-page photo of a nude girl.

                                RACHAEL
                  Is this testing whether I'm a
                  replicant or a lesbian?

                                DECKARD
                  You show the pciture to your
                  husband.  He likes it and hangs
                  it on the wall.  The girl is lying
                  on a bearskin rug.

                                RACHAEL
                  I wouldn't let him.

                                DECKARD
                  Why not?

                                RACHAEL
                  I should be enough for him.

        Deckard frowns, then smiles.  His smile looks a little
        like a grimace or the other way around.

                                DECKARD
                  Last question.  You're watching
                  an old movie.  It shows a banquet
                  in progress, the guests are enjoying
                  raw oysters.

                                RACHAEL
                  Ugh.

        Both needles swing swiftly.

                                DECKARD
                  The entree consists of boiled
                  dog stuffed with rice.

        Needles move less.

                                DECKARD
                         (continuing)
                  The raw oysters are less acceptable
                  to you than a dish of boiled dog.

        Deckard switches off his beam.

                                TYRELL
                  Well, Mr. Deckard?

        Deckard is looking at Tyrell and wincing indecisively.

        He doesn't get it.  Are they playing with him?

                                TYRELL
                         (continuing)
                  Perhaps some privacy will loosen
                  your tongue, Mr. Deckard.

        He turns to Rachael

                                TYRELL
                  Would you step out for a few moments,
                  Rachael?

        Rachael exits looking a little shaken.  What's going
        on?

        Deckard stares at Tyrell.

        Tyrell meets his look.

                                TYRELL
                  I'm impressed.  How many questions
                  does it usually take to spot one?

                                DECKARD
                  I don't get it.

                                TYRELL
                  How many questions ?

                                DECKARD
                  In columns of four cross referenced,
                  twenty or thirty.

                                TYRELL
                  It took more than a hundred for
                  Rachael, didn't it ?

                                DECKARD
                  She really doesn't know ?

                                TYRELL
                  She's beginning to suspect, I think.

                                DECKARD
                  Suspect!  How can she not know
                  she is.

                                TYRELL
                  Well, we began to notice in them
                  a strange obsession.

        Tyrell is pacing now, lecturing.

                                TYRELL
                  After all, they are emotionally
                  inexperienced with only a few
                  years inwhich to store up the
                  experiences which you and I take
                  for granted.  If we gift them
                  with a past... we create a
                  cushion or pillow for their
                       emotions.. and we can
                  control them better.

                                DECKARD
                  They want memories?

                                TYRELL
                  It's the dark corners, the little
                  shadowy places that makes you
                  interesting, Deckard..... gusty
                  emotions on a wet road on an
                  autumn night.. the change of
                  seasons..... the sweet guilt
                  after masturbation.

                                DECKARD
                  Jesus  Christ,Tyrell!

        Tyrell looks startled.

                                DECKARD
                  Where do you get them, the
                  memories?

                                TYRELL
                  In the case of Rachael, I simply
                  copied and regenerated cells from
                  the brain of my sixteen-year-
                  old niece.  Rachael remembers
                  what my little niece remembers.

                                DECKARD
                  I saw an old movie once.  The
                  guy had  bolts in his head.

        Deckard looks amazed while Tyrell looks pleased with
        himself.

        EXT. OVERHEAD VIEW OF HOTEL - NIGHT

        The hotel is in a seedy part of town.


        EXT. ANGLE ON DECKARD - NIGHT

        Deckard and Gaff are standing in front of the hotel,
        looking it over.

        Deckard glances at a crumpled piece of paper in his
        hand with an address scrawled on it.

        He glances at the hotel.  The address is correct.

        Deckard and Gaff enter the hotel, leaving frame.

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

        A dingy, trash-filled corridor.

        An OLD MAN leads Deckard and Gaff to a door.  The Old
        Man is wearing an oxygen tank taking occasional hits
        of air from a mask.  He unlocks the door.

        Deckard and Gaff enter wearily, hands inside their
        coats on their weapons.

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

        The room is dark and ominous, full of danger.

        Deckard studies the shadows, weapon ready.

        Satisfied the room is empty, he hits the wall switch.

        A four-tube fluorescent light overhead flutters weakly
        to half-life, two tubes.

        Deckard studies the room.

        It's clean in contrast to the littered hallway.  A bed,
        a wardrobe, a small desk, a chair.  Spartan, almost
        military.

        Gaff has seated himself on the windowsill.  Except for
        his eyes he is motionless like a statue.

        Deckard reaches into his pocket and takes out infrared
        goggles which he puts on.  He looks strange wearing the
        goggles.

        The room, from his POV, is seen in high contrast,
        every speck of dust in bright white, the fingerprints
        on the wall standing out like paintings, Gaff appear-
        ing eerie and ominous.

        Deckard starts to inspect the room with great care,
        feeling the moulding, inspecting the mattress on the
        bed, studying the fingerprints on the wall.

        Gaff watches motionless.

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT (A LITTLE LATER)

        Deckard has opened the wardrobe.

        He's inspecting the suit neatly hung there.  He feels
        in the pockets.  He pulls out a packet of about sixty
        photographs.  He thumbs them.  Very ordinary looking
        snapshots.  Maybe he notices a couple of strange ones.
        Maybe not.

        Deckard pockets the pictures and continues his inspec-
        tion.

        Gaff sits motionless like a statue.


        INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

        Deckard, still wearing goggles, is checking the inside
        of the medicine cabinet in the tiny bathroom.

        Nothing.  Clean.

        He shuts the cabinet and sees himself in the mirror
        in infrared wearing goggles.  Weird.

        He exits the neat, tiny bathroom.

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

        Deckard steps out of the bathroom, notices something
        on the floor.

        Gaff is motionless.

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

        Deckard is on his hands and knees studying the floor.
        He picks up a little speck on his finger, studies it.

        He picks up another.

        He puts the speck in his wallet.

        Gaff sits motionless on the sill.

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT (A LITTLE LATER)

        Deckard takes off the goggles.  He motions Gaff off
        the sill with his head.

        Deckard steps to the window, pulls the photos from
        his pocket and studies them in the faint light from
        outside.

        Snapshots.  Very ordinary.

        Gaff stands near the door, watching Deckard.

        Deckard shuffles through the pictures in front of the
        window.

                                                   CUT TO:


        EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT

        Leon is looking up at the hotel.

        He can see Deckard in the window looking at pictures.

        Leon is breathing hard, angry.

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

        Deckard feels funny as he studies the pictures, his
        mind changes focus.  He steps aside, against the wall,
        and glances out of the window.

        Gaff watches Deckard and frowns uncomprehending.

        Deckard, satisfied at what he sees out the window,
        studies the photographs again, but not in front of
        the window.

        Gaff, frowning, approaches the window and looks out,
        puzzled.

                                                   CUT TO:


        EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT

        An angry Leon sees Gaff peering out the window above.

        Leon's eyes blaze with anger.  He turns and runs off.

                                                   CUT TO:


        EXT. STREET - NIGHT

        A blimp is drifting silently over the city reflect-
        ed in an eyeball while we hear the SOUNDS OF THE
        STREET.

        The eyeball belongs to BATTY who is standing on
        the sidewalk. He resembles a tradition, the gym
        instructor, short, cropped hair with the body of a
        drill sergeant but the eyes are gray and chilling.
        Roy Batty is a presence of force with a lazy, but
        acute sense of what goes on around him.

        He lowers his attention from the sky to Leon.

        Leon approaches him.

                                BATTY
                  Did you get your precious photos?

                                LEON
                  Somebody was there.

                                BATTY
                  Police.

                                LEON
                  Just men.

                                BATTY
                  Police men.

        Leon looks sullen.  He doesn't know.

        Batty is looking at the storefront across the street,
        the one that says HANNIBAL CHEW over the door.

        Batty indicates the store to Leon with a head movement.

                                                   CUT TO


        INT. CHEW'S SHOP - NIGHT

        Eyes. Nothing but eyes swimming in a thick, clear
        solution.

        The eyes are in an aquarium inside Chew's shop.
        There are other aquariums and technical equipment.

        CHEW himself, wearing a heavy fur coat and gloves is
        hunched over a workbench in a pool of light doing
        meticulous work with a pair of forceps.  He is an
        ancient Asian and  his steamy breath and frosty beard
        indicate just how cold it is in this sub-zero
        laboratory.

        Chew dips the forceps into a vat at his side.
        Deep cold!

        The forceps and the tiny item in the forceps come out
        of the solution frozen solid.

        A SPEAKER on the wall CRACKLES and FARTS STATIC.

                                WALL SPEAKER
                  Mr. Chew.

        Chew keeps working.

                                CHEW
                  Aaaaaaaannnnn?

        The wall speaker is intermittent.

                                WALL SPEAKER
                  ... one... URP... wants... to
                  see you.

        Chew continues working.

                                CHEW
                  Busy!

                  ... talk to you... Nexus Six...
                  designs.

        Chew frowns and turns from his work disgruntled.

                                CHEW
                  Busy!

        Chew continues working while he mutters in Chinese.
        Peace returns, he calms down and works in chilly
        silence.

        Then the door opens.

        Standing in the doorway is Roy Batty.

        Chew gets up fuming.

                                CHEW
                  Busy!  Busy!  You go away!  Make
                  appointment.

        Chew bursts into Chinese.

        Batty smiles.  You would not want him to smile at you.

        Leon enters and closes the door.

                                CHEW
                       (apoplectic)
                  No!  No!  Cold!  Cold!  Go away.

        Batty smiles. His coat is already covered with ice.

                                BATTY
                  Questions.

                                CHEW
                  No!  No questions!

        Leon is staring at the floating eyes in an aquarium.

        Batty smiles pleasantly and glances at a tank of
        deep cold. Batty sticks his hand in.

                                CHEW
                        (urgently)
                  No! Cold!

        Batty still smioing, pulls his hand out. It's icy.

        Chew looks at Batty's hand and then at his smiling face.

        Chew screams in sudden discovery and outrage.

                                CHEW
                  You replicant!

        We looks at Batty's machine-gun smile, steam pouring
        from his nostrils as we hear the shrill, indignant
        voice of Chew being outraged.

                                CHEW'S VOICE (OS)
                  You illegal.  Can't come here!
                  Illegal.

        Batty is smiling his smokey smile and Chew is point-
        ing up.

                                CHEW
                  You not belong here. Up there!

                                BATTY
                  Fiery the Angels fell... And as they
                  fell deep thunder rolled around their
                  shores;
                  indignant,
                  burning with the fires of Orc.

        Chew is bug eyed. What is this shit?

        Batty reaches out and puts his hands on the collar of
        Chews's fur coat.

                                BATTY
                  Questions!

        RRRRRIIIIIIPPPP.Batty pulls the coat apart, it splits
        along the back seam and falls away like a banana peel.

        Chew is suddenly totally scared, totally cold and totally
        co-operative.

                                CHEW
                  Okay!  Answers!

        Chew is pointing to the wall pegs where more fur coats
        hang.

                  just eyes!

        Batty looks around the room at the tank of eyes, the
        muscle charts of eyes, the pictures of eyes.

                                BATTY
                  Ah!  I thought perhaps feet...
                  hands... muscle tissue.. or..
                  noses...

                  Just eyes. Gimee coat, okay?

        Leon is staring into the tank of eyes, trying not to
        blink.

        The eyes stare back at Leon, unblinkingly, arrogantly.

                                BATTY
                  My  eyes..... I guess you designed
                  them, eh?

                                CHEW
                  You Nexus? I design Nexus eyes.

        SMASH!  Leon, infuriated by the unblinking eyes, smashes
        the tank and the insolent eyes pour out onto the floor.

        Batty smiles and points to his own eyes.

                                BATTY
                  Ah, Chew.....

                  If only you could see the things
                  I have seen with your eyes.

        Squish!  Squish!  The squishes are Batty's feet
        stepping in eyeballs as he paces in front of Chew.

        Chew is blue and hysterical.

        Chew looks like heart attack city.  Is it going to
        go on forever?

        EXT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

        Deckard's car pulls up into a drive of a condominium
        block that looms against the night sky like a pile
        of cardboard boxes.

        Deckard gets out of the car wearily and heads for the
        front door.

                                                   CUT TO


        INT. ELEVATOR NIGHT

        The elevator is gloomy, poorly lit, full of shadows.

        Deckard asks for the 97th Floor.

        The ELEVATOR makes a creaking noise, very distinctive,
        and starts upward.

        Deckard frowns.  Something is wrong. He is suddenly
        very alert, ready.

        There are shadows behind him but he can't turn to look.

        The ELEVATOR CREAKS UPWARDS.

        Deckard goes for his blaster, gets it out quick and
        whirls.

        Rachael is there, in the shadows.

        Deckard's blaster is pointed at her.  One more second.....

        Deckard lowers the blaster.  He's shaking all of a sudden.

                                RACHAEL
                  I'm sorry.


        INT. CORRIDOR NIGHT

        Deckard exits the elevator and approaches his door.

        Rachael is behind him, she's desperate.

        Deckard takes out his wallet, it drops to the floor
        scattering his cards.

        Rachael picks up the cards.

                                RACHAEL
                  Let me help you.

                                DECKARD
                  What do I need help for?

        Deckard takes the card from her and starts to open
        the door.

                                RACHAEL
                  I don't know why he told you what
                  he did.

                                DECKARD
                  Talk to him.


        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

        The place is a mess.Deckard walks in leaving the door open.

                                RACHAEL
                  He wouldn't see me.

        Deckard goes into the kitchen, comes out with a towel drying
        his hair.  He walks to the cocktail cabinet and pours himself
        a drink.

                                DECKARD
                  I'm gonna have a drink.

                                RACHAEL
                  You think I'm a replicant, don't
                  you?

        Deckard takes off his wet raincoat and throws it on a chair.

                                RACHAEL
                  Look.

        She goes to him holding a picture in her hand.

        Deckard looks at it.

        It's an old snapshot, a little girl with a mother and father.

                                RACHAEL
                  It's me with my parents.

        Deckard hands it back to her slowly.  Finally speaks.

                                DECKARD
                  You remember when you were about six and you
                  and your brother snuck into an empty building....
                  through the basement window ?

                                RACHAEL
                  What? Y-yes....

                                DECKARD
                  You were going to play Doctor. He showed
                  you his, then you chickened and ran out.

                                RACHAEL
                  But....

        She looks up and he's staring at her, but she doesn't seem
        to notice.

                                DECKARD
                  Remember the bush outside your window
                  with the spider in it.

        Rachael looks up at him.

                                DECKARD
                  Green body, orange legs... you watched
                  her build a web all summer.

                                RACHAEL
                  Yes.

        Her voice is getting very small.

                                DECKARD
                  One day there was an egg in the webb.

        Rachael nods faintly.

                                RACHAEL
                  After a while, the egg hatched and
                  hundreds of baby spiders came out and
                  ate her.   That made quite an impression
                  on me, Mr. Deckard.

                                DECKARD
                  You still don't get it?

                                RACHAEL
                  No.. I... I .... don't.

        Deckard is now nasty, downright bitter.

                                DECKARD
                  Implants.  They are not your memories,
                  they belong to Tyrell's sixteen year
                  old niece.

        Rachael doesnt say anything, she can't.

                                DECKARD
                  He's very proud of them.  He ran them
                  on a scanner for me.

        Rachael just stares at him, stunned and barely holding on.

                                DECKARD
                  Still don't believe me ?

                                RACHAEL
                  I... I...

                                DECKARD
                  Right.  I made it all up.  You're not
                  a replicant. It was a nasty joke. Go home.

        Rachael is biting her lip or something, holding it back.

                                DECKARD
                  Go on.  Beat it.  Sorry.   Bad joke.

        Deckard sees  he's gotten through... maybe too far.

                                DECKARD
                  Wanna drink ?

        She's completely destroyed, silent.

                                DECKARD
                  I'll getcha one.

        Deckard hurries out.

        The CLOCK IS TICKING.

                                                   CUT TO


        INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

        Deckard is peering at her from the doorway, a Peeping
        Tom.  He sees the shaking hands.  He doesn't like this
        shit.

        He turns his attention to getting the drink.  The
        kitchen is a disaster area, dirty dishes overflowing
        from the sink the way a plant grows out of a pot.

        Deckard opens the refrigerator.  The contents aren't
        messy so much as unusual.  He opens the freezer com-
        partment and pulls out a bottle of Tsing Tao vodka
        and eyes it.  Half-empty.

        He rummages among the dirty dishes for a glass that
        doesn't actually have fungus growing in it.  He finds
        one that's only greasy, wipes it with a dirty towel
        (making it greasier) and pours vodka into it.

        He heads back into the living room.


        INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

        Deckard stops in the doorway,surprised.

        The room is empty. Rachael is gone.

        Deckard stares at the empty room for a long moment.  Then
        he chug-a-lugs the vodka. As he brings his head back and
        winces from the fiery booze he sees something.

        Something crumpled on the floor.

        He goes over and picks it up.

        It's the picture of Rachael with her parents. He studies
        it.

        On the other side is a phone number.

        Deckard walks over to the window and stares out.

        A spinner flashes by smearing light on his face.

                                                   CUT TO


        EXT. AN ABANDONED BUILDING - NIGHT

        Pris exits the building and starts across the street.

        A spinner rockets past overhead.  She reacts nervously
        watches the spinner slide away.

        She crosses the street past a window full of wedding dresses
        as the spinner zips off in the distance.


        EXT. SEBASTIAN'S BUILDING - NIGHT

        Pris walks under the art deco marquee between the twisted
        corduroy columns and into the foyer.

        She picks a spot near the entrance and is covering herself with
        old newspapers and trash for warmth when she hears a strange
        NOISE.

        A weird street cleaning MACHINE GRINDS past.

        Pris watches the machine with interest, then huddles
        under the trash.

        A battered old truck, Sebastian's, SPUTTER AND FARTS
        to a halt in front.

        SEBASTIAN gets out, a young man with skin that is yel-
        lowing into old parchment.  He's wearing a World War
        Two leather pilot's cap and dark goggles and carrying
        a pack.

        In spite of his youth, he carries himself like Old
        China as he walks toward the entrance with the gait
        of an old man.

        Sebastian stumbles over the trash covered body of Pris
        and Pris leaps to her feet and start to run like a
        frightened gazelle.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Hey!

        He reaches down and picks up the bag she left in the
        trash.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You forgot your bag.

        He's holding it up.

        She eyes him from a distance... unsure of him.  Then
        she moves toward him tentatively.

        Sebastian smiles awkwardly and holds out the bag.

                                PRIS
                  I'm lost.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Don't worry, I won't hurt you.

        Both of them are silent.  People are not Sebastian's
        forte... usually he's too shy, but this girl is shyer
        still.  Plus they're about the same age... it gives
        him courage.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  What's your name?

                                PRIS
                  Pris.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Mine's J.F. Sebastian.

                                PRIS
                  Hi.

        So pleased with the way that went, he forgets for a
        while what comes next.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Oh... where were you going?

        She shrugs.  That leaves him a lot of responsibility.
        He throws her side-long glances, but she's not helping.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Home?

                                PRIS
                  I don't have one.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Oh.

        She looks at him, a shadow of enticement in her clear
        blue eyes.

                                PRIS
                  We scared each other pretty good,
                  didn't we?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  We sure did.

        She giggles and laughs.

                                PRIS
                  I'm hungry, J.F.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I've got stuff inside, you wanna
                  come in.

                                PRIS
                  I was hoping you'd say that.

        Sebastian's grey face flushes with pleasure.  He turns
        and inserts a key in the ornate iron mesh door and

        Stacks of gaudy balconies loom into shadows above.

        Overhead lights reveal a shark-like blimp cruising
        above the building glowing with advertisements.

        Pris stares in wonder.

                                PRIS
                  And you live in this building all
                  by yourself ?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Yeah, I live here pretty much alone
                  right now....

        Pris and Sebastian are standing in the mesh elevator
        as it grumbles noisily into the shadows above.


        INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT (SHOT)

        Sebastian and Pris walk down the corridor towards
        his apartment .

                                PRIS (WILD LINE)
                  No housing shortage around here.

                                SEBASTIAN (WILD LINE)
                  Plenty of room for everybody... most
                  of the others have emigrated already.


        INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

        Sebastian is unlocking his door.  He opens the door
        and ushers Pris into the apartment.


        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT -NIGHT

        Sebastian flicks on the light revealing the high
        walls, elegant moulding and strange contents.

        A three foot high Kaiser Wilhelm figure and a teddy
        bear dressed as Napoleon march into view from a
        doorway.  An alarm sounds.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Yoo hoo, home again, home again!

                                BEAR
                  Good evening J.F.

        The alarm cuts out.

        The Bear and Kasier  Wilhelm stare woodenly at Pris
        for a moment, then turn away disappearing into the gloom.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  They're my friends... here,
                  can I take your things, they're soaked.

                                BEAR
                            (muttering)
                  Home again, home again, jiggidy jig.

        Pris is delighted.  She strips off her topcoat,
        revealing a shape to pop eyes.

                                SEBASTIAN
                            (besides himself)
                  Where are your folks ?

                                PRIS
                  I'm sort of an orphan.

        Pris smiles.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  What about friends?

                                PRIS
                  I have some, but I have to find them....
                  I'll let them know where I am tomorrow.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Oh!

        There is a silence. He steals a glance at her.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Well..... I can sleep on the couch.

        INT. DECKARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

        A blurry photograph, unclear, FILLS THE SCREEN.

        The photograph intensified.  The foreground BLURS AND
        SHARPENS.  it's the "man" in Leon's room with the
        wardrobe behind him.  The head is turned away and
        downward, the face unreadable.

        Another change!  A dramatic one.  The picture is
        suddenly three dimensional.

        Now we see that Deckard is studying the picture in a
        viewer controlling the effects with punch controls.

        The ashtray next to him is full of butts.  The bottle
        of vodka is nearly empty.

        He sucks on his cigarette and empties the vodka bottle
        into his glass and goes back to peering into the
        viewer.

        He punches up.

        A transparent grid with vectors is superimposed over
        the photo.

        Deckard's eyes move over it carefully.

                                DECKARD
                  Sharpen line forty-eight between
                  twenty point twenty-seven.

        The edge of the man sharpens.

                                DECKARD
                  Profile trace.

        Slowly the view tracks the periphery of the man's
        shoulder, up and around the skull, down the other
        side and as it approaches the bottom of the picture
        passes a miniscule sparkle...

                                DECKARD
                  Stop.  Back up.

        The line is retraced.

                                DECKARD
                  Stop.

        The faintest little sparkle.  Static.  Almost nothing.
        Deckard leans forward.

                                DECKARD
                  Enhance.

        The view squeezes in.  The "spark" seems to be coming
        from about fifteen feet behind the figure -- from
        within the wardrobe.

                                DECKARD
                  Seesaw.

        After a short pause, as if the command causes the
        machine to strain, it emits a thin, high-pitched
        FREQUENCY SOUND and the picture begins a horizontal
        yawing motion.  As it swings back and forth glimpses
        of things previously obscured by the foreground
        figure are revealed.  Slightly at first, but the
        opening grows as the process picks up momentum.

        Deckard's right down there, hands on his knees like
        a man watching his favorite team make a crucial play.

                                DECKARD
                  Stop!

        The picture freezes.

                                DECKARD
                  Enhance.

        The view pushes in to the wardrobe.  In its gloomy
        recesses hangs a dress.

                                DECKARD
                  Enhance.

        In closer on the dress.  An exotic shimmering gown
        made of sequins.  Deckard ponders it, smiles slightly.

                                DECKARD
                  I don't suppose one of those males
                  has a transvestite problem.

        Pause.

                                DECKARD
                  Hey!

        Esper wakes up.

                                ESPER
                  Yes?

                                DECKARD
                  I said, I don't suppose one of
                  those males has a transvestite
                  problem.

        Pause.

                                ESPER
                  Negative.

        Deckard considers the situation for a few moments,
        then frowns thoughtfully and fishes his wallet out of
        his pocket.  He produces the flakes he found in the
        hotel room.

        Deckard lights a cigarette.

        The flake.

        He's holding it on the tip of his finger under the
        light of the console screen.  He sits down, studying
        it like Hamlet, contemplating Yorick's skull.  But
        for the HUM OF THE MACHINE, a long silence.

                                ESPER
                  You're gonna have a fire if you
                  don't turn off the machine.

        Absently, Deckard reaches out and flips it off.  He
        sits a while in the silent dark.  Then goes into the
        bathroom.


        INT. SHOWER - NIGHT

        Deckard stands in the shower, his cigarette still in
        his mouth.

                                                   CUT TO:


        EXT. NOODLE BAR - NIGHT

        It might be 2:00 a.m. but the joint is still crowded
        as noisy taxi drivers jostle each other for seats and
        jabber in Kangaroo, a crude lingual mix of Chinese,
        Japanese, French and Tagalog.

        Deckard is hunched over his bowl of noodles, slurping
        hungrily from his busy chopsticks.

        Whap!  The counterman slaps a serving of fish heads on
        the counter in front of a CHINESE sitting next to
        Deckard.

        Startled by the sound Deckard glances at the bowl of
        fish heads, then turns his attention back to his
        noodles.

        But after two bites he frowns and turns to look at
        the fish heads again.

        The Chinese is eating the flesh hungrily from a head.
        He cleans the skull and drops it on the plate.

        Deckard stares at the heads with their blank stares
        that seem to gaze at eternity.

        Deckard is thinking.

        The Chinese is eating.

        Deckard frowns lost in furious thought.  Suddenly he
        reaches out and grabs a fish head.

        The Chinese goes bug-eyed with indignation.

                                CHINESE
                         (in Chinese)
                  What the hell are you doing, you
                  moronic ahng mo dim bulb?  That's
                  my goddamn dinner you (in English)
                  dumb shit!

        Deckard is peeling scales off the fish head.  He grabs
        his wallet, produces the flake and compares it to the
        scales from the head.  He ignores the ranting of the
        Chinese as he stares at the flake next to the scales.

                                DECKARD
                  Fish!

                                CHINESE
                         (in Chinese)
                  What do you expect you get from
                  fish head, stupid?
                         (in English)
                  Elephant shit?

        EXT. ANIMAL ROW - NIGHT

        An aquarium full of fish, weird looking fish, the
        kind that might eat each other.  They're gliding in
        sinister clusters like Doberman pinschers with gills.

        The CAMBODIAN LADY is a withered woman in black.
        She's got a lens in her eye and she's looking at the
        flake which is on the tip of her finger.

                                CAMBODIAN LADY
                  Not fish!  Snake !

        And she points down the row.

        Deckard looks that way and we.........

        MICROSCOPIC VIEW - NIGHT

        We are looking at a huge enlargement of a snake scale
        seen through a microscope.. but we don't know that.
        It's just a grand abstract weirdness blurring and
        sharpening and changing.

                                EGYPTIAN (OS)
                  The finest quality, yeeeeeeessssss.
                  Perfect workmanship.
                  Geniune artificial snake.

        The flake  becomes a landscape of forests and moon-
        scapes.  Buried deep in the texture of the thing is a
        serial number.

                                EGYPTIAN (OS)
                  Serial Number 99069745xb7Y
                  That would indicate a Crotalus
                  Atrox......

        EXT. EGYPTIANS JOINT - NIGHT

        We see the Egyptian for the first time as he takes
        his eye from the viewer and points to a snake in one
        of the many tanks that writhe with groggy reptiles.

                                EGYPTIAN
                         (continuing)
                  ... such as that one there with
                  the black and white ring on tail.
                         (making a whirring noise)
                  Western Diamon Back....
                         (whirr)
                  Rattler.

        Deckard is looking at the ugly serpent.

        The Egyptian hands the scale back to Deckard.

                                DECKARD
                  Who made it ?

                                EGYPTIAN
                  This quality... not too many.

                                DECKARD
                  How many ?

                                EGYPTIAN
                  Very few.

                                DECKARD
                  How few ?

                                EGYPTIAN
                  Perhaps less than I thought....
                  but still, more than I can remember.

                                DECKARD
                  What helps you to remember ?

        The Egyptian pushes a hand out in front of him, revolving
        the thumb slowly against the next two fingers.

        Deckard slips a card out of his pocket and into the
        man's fingers.  It's a police card.  It gets a super-
        cilious smile, a sigh and a shrug.  And that's all
        it gets.  The man knows his rights.  The card is
        handed back.  The smile remains.

                                EGYPTIAN
                  What was the question again?

                                DECKARD
                  The question is...

        Deckard steps in closer.

                                DECKARD
                  Are you a citizen?

                                EGYPTIAN
                  Yes.

                                DECKARD
                  Naturalized?

                                EGYPTIAN
                  Yes.

                                DECKARD
                  Your papers are in order.

                                EGYPTIAN
                  Of course.

        This guy's got it covered.

                                DECKARD
                  You have a license for this
                  establishment?

        He points it out with a righteous finger.

                                DECKARD
                  Fire permit?

                                EGYPTIAN
                  Right here.

        He lifts it out of a drawer, displays it.  A long
        pause.  The Egyptian smiles smugly.  It pays to have
        things covered.  Deckard pushes closer.

                                DECKARD
                  In two seconds I'm gonna break
                  your fuckin' spine if you don't
                  tell me what I wanna know.

        Pause.

                                EGYPTIAN
                  I see.

        Deckard's face is two inches away.  It's all very
        plain.

                                EGYPTIAN
                  In that case, I think I will be obliged
                  to tell you that one of two men could
                  have done this.

                                DECKARD
                  Who ?

                                EGYPTIAN
                  Me.

        The Egyptian works on an uncertain shit-eating grin
        hoping to charm his way out of a hole.

        Deckard lets him sweat for a beat or two, looking hard.

                                DECKARD
                  Who do you sell your junk to .

                                EGYPTIAN
                  Artists. Always to artists.

        The Eygptian looks nervously at Deckard,sees he
        means business and hastily begins to shuffle through a
        wad of receipts from a cigar box.

                                                   CUT TO


        INT. TAFFEY'S SNAKE PIT BAR - NIGHT

        A big guy, back to camera is sitting at the bar in
        this sleazy joint.

                                DECKARD (OS)
                  You buy a snake off an Egyptian ?

        The big guy turns to face his questioner.  His name
        is TAFFEY LEWIS big and bad and low-life.  He looks
        like he's looking at a cockroach.

                                TAFFEY
                  Buzz off, fella.

        Deckard is searching in his pockets.  He pulls a dirty
        handkerchief out, puts it on the bar, pulls out a
        crumpled pack of cigs from another pocket, a wad of
        money cards from another.  He's putting all sorts of
        things on the bar.  Among them is the picture of
        Rachael and her parents.

                                DECKARD
                  You ever see..... you ever se... ?

        At last he finds the photo of the reclining woman, shows
        it to Taffey.

                                DECKARD
                  You ever see this woman ?

        Taffey doesn't even look at the picture.

                                TAFFEY
                  Never saw her.  Buzz off,pal.

        Deckard flashes his police card.

                                DECKARD
                  Got your licenses in order, old
                  buddy ?

                                TAFFEY
                  Pal, I got a license to piss,
                  I got a license to kiss,
                  An' I got a license to pee at
                  four in the morning.

                  I got licenses for things I do with
                  my wife an' I got licenses for things
                  I don't do with my wife.

                  I got licenses for bad dreams, pal.
                  I got licenses you wouldn't believe.
                  Now buzz the fuck off, okay ?

        Deckard seems blown away, puts his hands up, palms forward,
        surrendering.

                                DECKARD
                  Take it easy mister, don't get
                  excited.

                                TAFFEY
                  Nobody pushes me around.

                                DECKARD
                  Forget I asked.  My mistake.
                  Water under the bridge.

        Taffey looks a little startled. It was this easy ?  He's
        kind of pleased with himself now that he's firmly estab-
        lished his authority.

                                TAFFEY
                  No hard feelings. I just don't
                  take a push, that's all.

                                DECKARD
                  No hard feelings.

                                TAFFEY
                         (to the bartender)
                  Louis, the man's dry.  Give him
                  one on the house, huh ?

                                BARTENDER
                  Whatcha drinking ?

                                DECKARD
                  Smokey, dry.

                                TAFFEY
                  You assed about a snake.....

        Deckard is suddenly hopeful.

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.....

                                TAFFEY
                  Wanna see a snake, huh?

        The Bartender puts a weird drink in front of Deckard...
        tiny worms floating in a viscous liquid.

        Deckard takes the drink like he was used to it and swigs.

                                TAFFEY
                  Louis, show the cop the snake,
                  willya?

        The Bartender reaches under the bar and pulls out a
        large snake that writhes lazily on the bar.  It is
        bright gold.

                                DECKARD
                      (disappointed)
                  Wrong snake.

                                TAFFEY
                  Don't like gold ?

                                DECKARD
                  Gold's okay.

                                TAFFEY
                  Original paint job was shitty.  Those
                  fucking Egyptian's do crappy work.

                                DECKARD
                  How long ago did ya paint it?

                                TAFFEY
                  I dunno.  Couple of months.
                  Why ?

         Deckard looks discouraged, swigs the last of his drink.

                                DECKARD
                  No reason.  Doesn't matter.
                      (to the bartender)
                  Gimmee another, willya?

        There is a burst of applause and they all look around
        toward the stage.

        A large egg has appeared on the stage, beside it a
        smaller egg.

                                TAFFEY
                  Getta loada this. New act.
                  Very artistic, very sen-shoe-all.
                  Beautiful.

        Music starts to play.

        Deckard looks bored and discouraged.  Absently starts
        picking up his junk off the bar... the wads of money cards,
        cigarette packs, matches... the picture of Rachael.  That
        catches his attention.

        Deckard stares at the picture for a long moment.

                                DECKARD
                  Gotta phone ?

                                                   CUT TO


        INT. TAFFEY'S BAR MOMENTS LATER

        Deckard is at a telephone not far from  the bar.  He's
        got the phone hooked between his shoulder and ear while
        he notes a number.

                                DECKARD
                  .......six six five. Thanks.

        Deckard breaks the connection, then starts punching the
        numbers.

        Behind him the stage show is progressing.  A beautiful
        woman named SALOME is emerging from the large egg, very
        scantily clad, an erotic birth scene.

        Rachael appears on the telephone vid-screen.

                                RACHAEL
                  Hello.

                                DECKARD
                  People have walked out on me
                  before... but never when I was
                  being charming.

        Rachael freezes when she see who it is.  Says nothing.

                                DECKARD
                  Ya missed out on the drink I
                  poured ya.

        Rachael still says nothing.

                                DECKARD
                  Wanna try again ?

        For a long moment it seems Rachael isn't going to say
        anything.

        Rachael is bitter.

                                RACHAEL
                       (on Vid-screen)
                  Hunting... "skin jobs "?

                                DECKARD
                  Didn't find any.All I found was a bar.
                  Why waste it ?

                                RACHAEL
                       (on vid-screen)
                  Not my kind of place I'm afraid.

                                DECKARD
                  Meet me here.  We'll go someplace
                  else.  It's in the Fourth Sector....

        Something on the stage catches Deckard's eye. He frowns.

        On stage, a snake has emerged from the second egg.

        Deckard is suddenly pre-occupied with the stage show as
        he absently gives the address over the phone.
