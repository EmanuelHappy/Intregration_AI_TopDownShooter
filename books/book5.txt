                                DECKARD
                  ...... the  Fourth Sector, on the line.
                  Taffey Lewis'  Snake Pit.

                                RACHAEL
                  I don't think so Mr. Deckard.
                  As I said......

        Deckard is staring at the stage show.

                                DECKARD
                         (absently)
                  See ya in a half hour.

        He hangs up.

        On stage, the snake and Salome are into sexy stuff.

                                                   CUT TO


        INT. BACKSTAGE A LITTLE LATER

        You can hear applause and catcalls from the audience
        as Salome flounces backstage.  She starts toward the
        dressing room.

        Deckard emerges from the shadow.

                                DECKARD
                  Excuse me, Miss  Salome....

        She turns.  Deckard's posture and attitude suggest humble,
        sleazy persistence.  He comes closer with his shit-eating
        grin.

                                DECKARD
                  I'd like to have a word with you
                  if I could.

        Salome stands almost six feet tall in her high heels and
        looks down on him with haughty suspicion... a girl who
        knows how to handle cheap hits.

                                SALOME
                  Yeah ?

                                DECKARD
                  I'm with the  American Federation of
                  Variety Artists....

        He holds up a hand as if to stop her from protesting.

                                DECKARD
                  Don't worry, I'm not here to
                  make you join... that's not my department.

        He glances around like a guy who's not supposed to be
        there.

                                DECKARD
                  I'm an investigator for the Confidential
                  Committee on Moral  Abuses.

        She nods, taking it a little more seriously.

                                DECKARD
                  There's been reports of the
                  management taking liberties with
                  the artists in this place.

                                SALOME
                  I don't know nothing about it.

                                DECKARD
                  You haven't felt yourself to be
                  exploited by the management in
                  any way?

        She's definitely puzzled.

                                SALOME
                  How do you mean 'exploited'?

                                DECKARD
                  Like to get this job... did you
                  or were you asked to do anything
                  lewd or unsavory or otherwise
                  repulsive to your person?

                                SALOME
                  Are you for real?

                                DECKARD
                  Oh, yeah.  You'd be surprised
                  what goes on around here.  I'd
                  like to check the dressing room
                  if I could.

                                SALOME
                  What the fuck for?

                                DECKARD
                  For holes.

        This guy might be an asshole, but he's funny.

                                SALOME
                  I don't believe this.

        She shrugs and they go in.


        INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

        Musty, cramped.  A portable shower, a dressing table
        and not much else.  On the dressing table lies a snake.
        Deckard watches it undulate into the warmth of the
        lights.

                                DECKARD
                  Is that mother for real ?

                                SALOME
                  Of course he's not real.  You think
                  I'd be working here if I could afford
                  a real snake ?

        Deckard reaches out to touch it.  As his fingers make
        contact, there's an electric "snap".  he jerks his hand
        back from the shock.

        Salome is taking off her costume.  There's not much to
        take off.

        Deckard gets a glimpse of nakedness as she slips behind
        the screen and turns on the shower.

                                DECKARD
                  How long you been doing a snake act ?

                                SALOME
                  What is it with you... you looking for
                  holes or what ?

        He starts pacing the room like's he's inspecting the walls.

                                DECKARD
                  You'd be surprised - they have their ways
                  of doing their dirty work without the victim
                  even knowing what's going on.

        His fingers are moving over her gowns. There's about six of
        them, on hangers, but nothing quite like the one in Leon's
        closet.

                                DECKARD
                  You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through
                  to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.

                                SALOME
                  No, I wouldn't.

                                DECKARD
                  Little dirty holes they drill in the wall
                  so they can watch a lady undress.

        And to his amazement, low on the wall, behind the dresses,
        he actually spots one. He moves down for a peek.

                                SALOME
                  And what if somebody did try to "exploit"
                  me?  Who do I go to ?

        Deckard's peeking at a pair of fat legs in the next room.

                                DECKARD
                  Me.

                                SALOME
                  And who do I go to about you ?

        He looks around... she's out of the shower dripping nude.
        Her hair blonde and cropped short.  Her black hair is a wig
        which now hangs on the wall next to the shower.  She didn't
        look like Nexus designated Zhora to begin with, but even less
        now.

                                SALOME
                  So did you find any holes ?

        Deckard makes a sheepish grin.

                                DECKARD
                  One so far.

                                SALOME
                  You're a dedicated man.

        Her smile is an invitation.  She throws him a towel.
        He catches it and she turns her back to him.

                                SALOME
                  Dry me.

        The evening doesn't have to be a total waste.  Deckard
        steps up behind her and starts patting her down.

        On the dressing table in front of them the python
        noses through the cosmetics, tongue flicking, trying
        to get back to its mistress.  Caught up in the sensu-
        ousness of the moment, absently she reaches out to
        stroke the snake.

        Deckard works his way down her back, over her buns and
        as he reaches her thighs, sits on the cot.  Concen-
        trating on her buns, he leans back for a handier per-
        spective.  But jerks forward like he'd been stung as
        his ears are hit with the BUZZ OF RATTLES directly be-
        hind him.

        Partly hidden behind the pillow against the wall is
        the Egyptian's pride and joy, a four-and-a-half foot,
        ring-tailed diamondback rattler.  Its lethal looking
        spade-shaped head elevated out of its coiled body,
        tail erect and whirring madly.

        Deckard rolls off the cot going for his blaster as he
        hits the floor.  SALOME/ZHORA has her hand around the
        head of the python and, using it like a club, she
        brings it down with all her might.

        Deckard rolls out of the way as the SNAKE WHISTLES
        through the air with such force, it ruptures as it
        hits the floor.

        If Deckard's fast, Zhora's a blur.  As he FIRES, her
        foot kicks into his groin, and he doubles up with the
        pain of it.  He tries for a second shot but she's al-
        ready out the door carrying a raincoat.


        INT. PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

        Bottom lip between his teeth, Deckard hops out of the
        dressing room in time to see her go through the door at
        the other end of the hall.

        It hurts to move so fast, but he jack-legs after her,
        arrives at the door and flings it open.  Blackness.
        The SOUND OF HER HIGH HEELS CLATTER down the metal
        steps.


        EXT. STREET - OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

        It's RAINING HEAVILY.

        The front of the Opera House is open only to foot
        traffic these days.  A bizarre place on a Friday night,
        hawkers and whores, the rabble, the poor and the curi-
        ous mill around the crudely built platforms and
        brightly lit stands.  Zhora, in just a translucent
        raincoat, is not out of place in this flea market at-
        mosphere.  Trying not to run, she slices through the
        mob as quickly as she can.  Deckard is not far behind,
        dodging and side-stepping, trying to move against the
        tide of people scurrying for shelter.

        She comes to an intersection and turns out of the mall
        onto a less crowded street.  She glances over her
        shoulder as she breaks into a run and runs right into
        a couple of pedestrians.  All three go down.

        Deckard comes out of the crowd in time to spot her get-
        ting to her feet.  She sees him and runs.  The two
        pedestrians are in his line of fire.  He runs past
        them and drops to one knee, leveling his blaster.

                                DECKARD
                  Stop or you're dead!

        She doesn't.

        Deckard OPENS UP, squeezing off two quick misses.

        WHAP!  The corner of the building disintegrates --
        bricks imploding, dust in the air.

        FWAAAP!  Another miss!  A lamppost wrenched with a
        tight air implosion.  Twisted metal, a breath of smoke.

        Deckard FIRES again!

        WHUMP!  Zhora takes a hit in the back of the head, and
        that's it for her except her motor reflexes which keep
        her going right into a showcase window.

        CRASH!  Zhora explodes through a series of plate glass
        windows in adjoining shops.

        Deckard is trying to pour FIRE through the tunnel of her
        jagged wake, but after TWO MISSES his blaster CLICKS
        empty, CLICKS empty, CLICKS empty and he watches her
        go.

        Zhora breaks through one window after another, getting
        sliced, already shot, running on reflexes.  Glass
        sprays like fireworks as she smashes through the last
        two windows and into the street.  She's going too fast
        to stop.

        She hits a passing bus so hard she's smeared all over the
        side like a mural and the bus squeals to a halt.

        The rain has stopped and turned into a quiet DRIZZLE.
        WATER GURGLING down the gutters.

        Hunched over, breathing hard, Deckard comes slowly
        forward.  The crowd starting to gather.  Something here
        for everybody as they're coming from all directions.
        Deckard moves through them, ending up to the side of
        the bus.

        Zhora is wedged on her side, torn, bloody and broken.
        All she can move is her eyes -- they dart about like
        a wounded animal doomed in a trap and stop on
        Deckard.

        He's kneeled in the street, stooped low, head cocked at
        an awkward angle looking back at her.

        In the cramped and dripping darkness her eyes are turn-
        ing glassy.  The intervals between the FALLING DROPS OF
        WATER accentuate the silence until there is no dripping
        and even the gurgling gutters have receded into silence
        as the life drains out of Zhora's face until it's
        frozen, dead.

        Deckard's eyes slowly follow the rivulets of blood that
        lead over the slope of a blacktop to his shoes.  Deckard
        tries to repress his wince.  His eyes reveal that it's
        getting to him.  He's aware of the spectators around
        him.

        Looking up, he sees them moving nervously away from
        him with frightened looks.

        Then he sees her.  Rachael is standing in the crowd
        staring at the dead Zhora.

        Rachael's face reveals her horror.  She looks from Zhora
        to Deckard.

        Deckard feels her eyes burn into him.   He clicks his empty
        pistol stupidly.  CLICK CLICK.

        Lights from a spinner smear over the crowd, sirens whine.

        Deckard sees Rachael disappear into the crowd.

        Deckard starts to say something but anything he said would
        be drowned in siren noise.

        Rachael is swallowed up into the crowd near a big sign
        (or some other distinctive landmark).

                                                   CUT TO


        EXT. THE CROWD - NIGHT

        Leon and Batty are just faces in the throng of ASIANS
        and LATINOS. They too see the body of Zhora.

        Batty and Leon look very grim.

        They turn their attention to  Deckard.

        From their point of view they see a pantomime out of ear
        shot.... Deckard hastily flashes his badge at arriving
        COPS, points to Zhora, gives a couple of instructions and
        hurries off, passing under the big sign, leaving the cops
        to stare after him with amazement.

        Batty and Leon exchange a look. Batty makes a head movement.

        Leon heads off toward the big sign.

                                                   CUT TO


        EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

        The tide of STREET PEOPLE moves inexorbaly as Deckard,
        like a swimmer, moves through them, eyes busy, searching
        for Rachael.

        Thinks he sees her.

        Shoves his way through the crowd.

        Not her.

        Looks around in dispair.

        Catches sight of her half a block away.

        Deckard hurries after her. Calls out.

                                DECKARD
                  Rachael.  Wait.

        Rachael looks back, sees him.

                                DECKARD
                  Hold on.

        Rachael keeps going.

        Deckard is hurrying past the mouth of an alley.  Suddenly
        he's being hurried into the alley.

                                DECKARD
                  Hey.

        A big guy is collaring him and hauling him into the alley.

        Leon.

                                                   CUT TO


        EXT. ALLEY NIGHT

        A family of SAMOANS look up from their dismal cooking
        fire in the alley.

                                DECKARD
                  Hey, what the hell, buddy!

        The Samoan's faces are blank.  They stick by the fire and
        express no feelings anout the events in the alley.

        Deckard is swept off his feet and twirled around in
        Leon's bear-trap embrace.

        Leon lets go and Deckard hits the pavement, skidding
        hard enough to tear clothes and burn skin, but he
        rolls out of it and comes up with gun in hand; but Leon
        is so fast he's already there and kicks it out of his
        hand.

        Leon moves towards him, backing Deckard against the
        wall.

                                LEON
                  How come you knew where Zhora was
                  so quick?

        His hand is like lightning.  It shoots out, grabs Deckard's
        hair.

                                DECKARD
                  I showed pictures.  Somebody
                  recognized her.  I went to see.

        Deckard is pale.  The sweat is starting to run.

                                LEON
                  How old am I?

                                DECKARD
                  I don't know.

        The grip tightens and twists.

                                LEON
                  My birthday is April 10, 2017.
                  How long do I live?

                                DECKARD
                  Four years.

        He lets go.

                                LEON
                  More than you.

        Deckard's knees come up fast, but Leon's fist comes down
        faster, like a hammer.

                                LEON
                  Painful to live in fear, isn't it.

        Deckard is doubled over, hugging his thigh.

                                LEON
                  But that's how it is to be a slave.
                  The future is sealed off, he
                  grovels, he waits.

        Even hurt, Deckard is fast.  He goes for his ankle gun,
        but Leon's got it out of his hand before he can even
        raise it and throws it down the alley.

        Deckard hurls forward, knocking him off balance, and
        scrambles to get away.  Leon grabs him by the foot,
        drags him back and jerks him off the ground.

                                LEON
                  Sex, reproduction, security, the
                  simple things.  But no way to
                  satisfy them.  To be homesick
                  with no place to go.  Potential
                  with no way to use it.  Lots of
                  little oversights in the Nexus
                  Six.

        He slams Deckard into the wall.

                                LEON
                  I tell you, nothing is worse than
                  having an itch you can never scratch.

        Deckard slides down the wall to his knees and huddles
        protecting his head with his arms, waiting for the
        next one.

                                DECKARD
                  I agree with you.

        Leon folds his big hands together and raises them over
        his head, pausing just a second to savor the satisfac-
        tion of smashing Deckard's skull.

                                LEON
                  Too late.  Your mistake.

        The spasm that runs through Leon's face is not from
        satisfaction.  It's the bullet that went through his
        neck.  He hits the ground hard, his big teeth biting
        the air like a rabid dog.  Dead.

        Deckard has slumped to the ground where he sits propped
        into a sitting position by the wall, staring up in
        amazement at his deliverer.

        He sees Rachael standing there with his blaster,
        Rachael is staring at the body of Leon, stunned and
        shaken at what she has done.

        Deckard looks up at her, his eyes swollen into slits,
        his mouth and nose bloody.  He sees how shaken she is.

        Rachael turns and looks at him.  Their eyes meet.
        She drops the blaster.

        Deckard gets painfully to his feet, picks up the
        blaster and starts to reload it.  He doesn't make the
        same mistake twice.  He glances at her.

        Again their eyes meet.

                                                   CUT TO:


        EXT. 42ND STREET - 20 MINUTES LATER

        It's the 42nd Street of the future, a garish, wicked
        place.

        Deckard and Rachaek are walking together, almost
        zombies.

        Deckard is only a little less bloody and a lot more
        swollen.

        Rachael looks stoned on the horror of the killing.

                                DECKARD
                  There's only one thing that works
                  on cuts and bruises and long nights.

        She looks at him blankly.

                                                   CUT TO:


        EXT. KIOSK - MOMENTS LATER

        It's a grimy little tienda with a counter right on the
        sidewalk and shelves crammed with dusty bottles,
        bright packs of cigarettes, old magazines and assorted
        junk.  The SALESLADY wears an eyepatch and a sharp look
        in her good eye.

        Deckard and Rachael are facing her.

                                DECKARD
                  Tsing Tao.

        The Saleslady tries to hand Deckard a half pint but he
        shakes his head and points and she produces a fifth.

        Deckard is paying when he feels a tap on his shoulder.

        He turns and sees Gaff leering at him.

        Not what Deckard expected or wanted.  His eyes flicker
        a warning in Rachael's direction.

        Rachael is standing in the flow of pedestrians, Asians,
        Mexicans and Indians.  She has already seen Gaff and
        she gets the message in Deckard's eyes and allows her-
        self to drift away, part of the stream of humanity
        moving down the sidewalk.

        But Gaff's sharp eyes have picked up Deckard's look
        and he glances.

        What Gaff sees is the back of a woman's head in the
        crowd.

        Gaff looks back at Deckard and makes a head movement
        indicating the vehicle at the curb.

        It's a spinner and Bryant is grinning at the window,
        chewing on a heater.

                                BRYANT
                  Christ, Deckard, ya look almost as
                  bad as that tit job ya left under
                  the bus.  Almost.

        Deckard walks over to the spinner.

        Gaff is looking down the street, trying to make out the
        Caucasian woman disappearing in the crowd.

                                DECKARD
                  You get the call on the big one?

                                BRYANT
                  Bet your ass.  Two in one night,
                  you're the same old shitstorm,
                  aren't ya?
                         (to Gaff)
                  You could learn from this guy,
                  Gaff.  A goddamn one-man slaughter
                  squad, that's what he is, a real
                  shitstorm.

        Gaff has to smile and nod politely, that's his job.

        Deckard has followed Bryant's beady gaze to the obvious
        bottle he's holding in the paper bag.

                                DECKARD
                  I'm going home.

                                BRYANT
                  Home!  A killer like you!  I
                  figured you'd be up all night
                  slaughtering phonies.  Four to
                  go, thought you'd just leave
                  'em dead in the alleys for us
                  to pick up.  Haw!  Haw!  Come on,
                  Gaff.

                                DECKARD
                  Three.  There's three to go.

                                BRYANT
                  Huh?

                                DECKARD
                  There's three left.

                                BRYANT
                  Four.  That tit job you vee kayed
                  at the Tyrell Corp... disappeared.
                  She didn't even know she was skin
                  till you put the machine on her.
                  Some kinda brain plant, says Tyrell.

        Deckard has already noticed that Gaff is looking down
        the street in the direction Rachael went.

        Gaff feels Deckard's eyes, turns and leers cheerfully
        at Deckard.  Deckard meets the look... an ominous
        exchange.

                                BRYANT
                  Come on, Gaff.
                         (to Deckard)
                  Drink a couple for me, pal.

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. DECKARD'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

        Deckard is about to swig some Tsing Tao for Bryant.
        He puts the glass to his lip and the lip, caked with
        dry blood and swollen, splits again and blood gushes
        into the clear liquid in the glass.

        Deckard stares at the bloodstained drink ruefully, then
        takes a thirsty gulp and licks his bleeding lip.

        The ice in  Rachael's glass is RATTLING.  She's standing
        only a few feet away, half eaten by shadows, her eyes
        blank with shock.

        The reason the ice is rattling is because her hand is
        shaking.

        You can hear the CLOCK TICKING in the living room.

                                DECKARD
                  Me too.

        Rachael frowns and looks at him. What ?

                                DECKARD
                  I get 'em bad. It's part of the
                  business.

        Deckard holds out his hands.  They're shaking.

        Rachael gives Deckard a long hard look.

                                RACHAEL
                  I'm not in the business.

        Deckard meets her look, understands he cannot comfort
        her so easy, she will not be one of the boys with him.

                                RACHAEL
                  I am the business.

        She is grim and angry and shaking.

        You can hear the clock TICKING.

                                                   CUT TO


        INT. DECKARD'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

        SPLASH.   Deckard sticks his head in the sink full of
        water and the water turns crimson.

        He lifts his face out of the water, dripping and gropes
        for a towel, wipes water blindly from his face.


        INT. DECKARD'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

        Rachael is in the foreground shadows, a drink in her hand.
        She's watching Deckard who is washing his face in the
        bathroom,framed by the open door.  You get the

        Deckard in the background, goes on drying.  He's naked
        except for a towel around his waist.

        Rachael takes a drink.  Her face is enigmatic.  She's
        watching.

        Deckard is unaware of her eyes on the back of his neck.

        She's looking at the ripple of muscle around his
        shoulders.

                                                   CUT TO


        INT. DECKARD'S BATHROOM A FEW MINUTES LATER

        Deckard is standing in front of the mirror.  He's
        staunched the bleeding lip and now he's studying it.

        The rustle of silk.

        Rachael appears in the doorway of the bathroom, drink
        in hand.

        Deckard doesn't acknowledge her presence.

        There is a long silence. She sees the muscle ripple in
        his naked back.  Hard body.  Scars of old wounds.

                                RACHAEL
                  What if I   go   North...
                  disappeared ?

        Deckard gives her a look, turns back to the mirror.
        Puts a towel over his head.

                                RACHAEL
                  Would you come hunting. ?

        Rachael waits a long tense moment for an answer.

                                DECKARD
                  No.

        Deckard waits before he lets it out.

                                DECKARD
                  I guess I owe you.

        Deckard turns and brushes past her so she has to
        step back.

                                DECKARD
                  But somebody will.


        INT. BEDROOM (NIGHT)

        Deckard is sitting on the bed, wasted, still in his
        towel, clean white bandages on his face.  He touches his
        lip gently.

        He can hear the clock ticking and then the whisper of her
        stockings as she approaches the bedroom from the hallway.
        He hears her stop, lost in the shadows beyond the door.
        A pause then her voice.

                                RACHAEL (OS)
                  The file on me.. the incept date,
                  the longevity, the psycho-program,
                  those things.....

        Her voice hesitates, stops.  Deckard sits there as the
        clock ticks for a long moment.

        In the corridor, lost in shadows, Rachael is working up
        the nerve to ask.

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah ?

        In the shadows Rachael takes a deep breath.

                                RACHAEL
                  You saw them?

        Deckard, exhausted stares absently into space.

                                DECKARD
                  They're classified.

        In the corridor, Rachael persists with effort.

                                RACHAEL
                  You're a policeman.

        Deckard touches a spot on his forehead, looks at the
        wall.

                                DECKARD
                  I didn't look at them.

        In the hallway, Rachael is hardly breathing.

                                DECKARD (O.S.)
                  I didn't want to.

        It must come as a tremendous relief to her.  She stands
        in the shadows, grateful for the smallest favours.  She
        waits a moment, hearing the clock ticking,  hearing the
        distant noises of an apartment house, then she speaks
        again.

                                RACHAEL
                  That test of yours.. The Voight
                  Kampff test......

        She pauses before completing the question. It's a
        biggie.

                                RACHAEL
                            (continuing)
                   .... did you ever take it yourself ?

        Rachael waits for a long moment in the shadows.

        The clock ticks.

        No answer.

        She moves into the light from the bedroom door and
        peers in.

        Deckard is lying on the bed, snoring gently.

        INT. LIVING ROOM NIGHT 

        The CLOCK IS LOUDER in the living room.

        Rachael walks through the shadowy room lit by a single
        lamp.

        She sees a picture of Deckard's wife and son on a
        table.

        She looks at it for a long moment as though she might
        be jealous.

        She sees a picture on top of the piano.

        A picture of a little boy and his father in fishing
        clothes, each holding a pole, the boy proudly display-
        ing a single under-sized fish, the hint of a smile on
        the father's face.

        She looks at the sheet music on the piano, Chopin.

        She stands close to the keys and starts to play.  She
        makes a mistake almost immedaitely.  She sits and
        starts again and she is just a hair tentative, but
        there's no mistake... the feeling, the rhythm, the
        beauty of the music.  It fills the whole apartment.

        Deckard is snoring peacefully as the MUSIC ebbs and
        flows.

        An ugly day is beginning to an eerie distortion of CHOPIN

        Nasty MUSIC a dismal looking building.

        Do we see strange figures in overcoats from a distance.


        INT. SEBASTIAN'S BUILDING - DAWN 

        A shark's POV of the stairways, hallways, the one's we'll
        see later a shark's POV gliding along the hall towards
        Sebastian's apartment. Chopin the ax murderer!


        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - DAWN

        Pris is filling the hours of insomniacal boredom by
        experimenting with her make up. A bleached white face
        and black ringed eyes. A sexual waif. A savage doll.
        She gets up and starts exploring the rooms.


        INT. WEDDING DRESS ROOM - DAWN

        She wanders into a large room filled with mannequins
        dressed in dusty ball gowns.

        She wanders around wistfully, full of curiosity. She picks
        out one of the dresses puts it on and stands there, the
        mannequins surrounding her like a family tableau.


        INT. SEBASTIAN LABORATORY - DAWN

        Sebastian is asleep, Kaiser Wilhelm his mouth clamped open
        is propped up next to him.

        Pris wanders in, studying the array of his equipment. She
        puts her eye to the steroscope near Sebastian. It reveals
        a world of rare beauty. Landscapes, mountains etc.

        She touches a button, a blue flash erupts.

                                PRIS
                  Oh!

        Sebastian is awakened.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Whatcha doin'.

                                PRIS
                  I'm sorry, just peeking.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Oh.

        Transfixed, Sebastian stares at her. If an improvement is
        possible, she looks even better now. Older and even sexier.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You look better.

                                PRIS
                  Just better.

                                SEBASTIAN
                         (blushing)
                  Well... beautiful.

                                PRIS
                  Thanks.

        As they are talking, Batty enters               the room.
        Pris sees  him but does not register anything on her face.
        Sebastian does not hear or see him.

        Pris studies  Sebastian for a moment.

                                PRIS
                  How old are you ?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Twenty.

                                PRIS
                  What's your problem?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Methuselah Syndrome.

                                PRIS
                  What's that's?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  My glands.  They grow old too fast.

                                PRIS
                  Is that why you're still on earth?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Yeah. Couldn't pass the medical. Anyway
                  I kinda like it here.

        A moment.

                                PRIS
                  And I like you just the way you are.
                  Hi Roy.

        Sebastian whips round. He is flanked a hair's breath away
        by Batty. The shock almost knocks him off his chair.

                                PRIS
                  This is my friend     I was
                  telling you about.

        Batty smiles benevolently.

                                PRIS
                  Roy, this is my saviour, J.F. Sebastian.

        There is a long silence whilst everyone stares at each
        other.

                                BATTY
                  Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian.

        Sebastian, still uneasy begins to smile.

                                BATTY
                  You certainly have a nice place.

        BATTY looks around admiringly.  Sebastian mumbles some-
        thing that sounds like "Thank you".

                                PRIS
                  Sebastian doesn't go out too much.

                                BATTY
                  I like a man who stays put. An admirable
                  thing to be able to sustain yourself
                  in these times. You live here all by
                  yourself, do you ?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Yes....
                         (after a moment)
                  How about some breakfast, I was just
                  going to make some.

                                                   CUT TO


        INT DECKARD'S BEDROOM - MORNING

        Deckard wakes up groggily. His face hurts. He touches
        the puffy purple bruises.  He touches the lip and winces.
        He looks around stupid with sleep, orienting himself.

        He sits up... tries to remember.  Was she here ?  Were they
        talking ?  He must have dozed off.  He gets up laboriously,
        painfully and limps out of the bedroom still in yesterday's
        clothes.
 
                                                   CUT TO


        INT. DECKARD'S LIVING ROOM MORNING

        Rachael is sitting stone silent at the piano, staring at a
        picture of Deckard and his Father above the keyboard.

        Shadows brush across her, then Deckard is there, close to
        her, looking to see what's got her attention.

                                DECKARD
                  Me and my Dad.

                                RACHAEL
                  Do you love him?

                                DECKARD
                  He's dead.

        Rachael indicates the picture of Deckard's wife.

                                DECKARD
                  Wife.

                                RACHAEL
                  Do you love her ?

                                DECKARD
                  She left me.
                         (pause)
                  Went offworld.
                  Wanted the good life.

                                RACHAEL
                  You didn't?

        Deckard changes the subject.

                                DECKARD
                  I dreamt music.

        Rachael answers his comment by touching the keys and
        filling the room abruptly with music.

        Deckard

                                RACHAEL
                  I didn't know if I could play.
                         ( pause)
                  I remember lessons.... but I
                  don't know if I took them... or
                  Tyrell's niece.

        She stops doesn't finish the thought, goes on playing
        for a long moment.

                                DECKARD
                  You play fine.

        Suddenly she stops playing and turns to him.  Al you
        can hear is the CLOCK TICKING.

                                RACHAEL
                  Am I very different?

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah.

                                RACHAEL
                  How?

        Her voice is small.  Something very young about her.
        She looks up at him for the first time.

                                DECKARD
                  Stand up.

        She does.  She's looking up at him with those big mer-
        maid eyes and he kisses her mouth.  And then again.
        She doesn't respond.  His voice is a whisper.

                                DECKARD
                  Now you kiss me.

        She does -- but it's self conscious...

                                RACHAEL
                  I can't rely on my memory to...

        He stops her with another kiss.

                                DECKARD
                  Say what I say.

        She nods.  His voice intimate, low.

                                DECKARD
                  Kiss me.

                                RACHAEL
                  Kiss me.

        He does, soft, wet, tender.  He backs off -- magnetic,
        palpable energy growing up between them.

                                DECKARD
                  My eyes.

                                RACHAEL
                  Kiss my eyes.

        She closes them.  He kisses each fluttering lid.

        She's catching on quick.  Her lips are right there.

                                DECKARD
                  I want you.

                                RACHAEL
                  I want you.

                                DECKARD
                  Again.

                                RACHAEL
                  I want you.

        Her face is flushed.  His fingers go to her mouth --
        slowly over her lips and inside, into the wetness.  her
        head is leaning back, eyes shut.

                                RACHAEL
                  Bite me.

        His mouth goes to her neck, her ear.  His teeth evoke
        a shiver and a gasp as they take her flesh.  Her breath
        is coming faster.

                                RACHAEL
                  Put your hands on me.

        He rakes his fingers through her hair and pulls her
        into him.  His other hand molding and pressing her,
        working around her body and under into the privacy
        of her dress.

                                RACHAEL
                  Shall I take off my clothes?

                                DECKARD
                  Oh Yeah.

        He's kissing her hard, deep, soft. She's hardly able to
        talk she's so excited.

                                RACHAEL
                  Do whatever you want to me.

        He is and her legs can no longer hold her and she's
        sinking to the floor in his arms moaning, their words
        obscured by kisses.

                                                   CUT TO


        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

        Pris is staring out the window, watching.

        Batty lies quietly on the couch, rubbing one of his hands.

        Sounds emanate from the kitchen.

        Batty gets up and goes to a chess set in the corner of the
        room, a game is obviously in progress.  Batty studies it for
        a moment, then moves the White Queen to the Bishop.

        Pris walks over to him. Her tone muted but demanding.

                                PRIS
                  Well?

        Batty finds her attitude amusing, which makes her even more
        pugnacious.

                                PRIS
                  I want to know what's going on ?

                                BATTY
                  There's only two of us left.

        Pris is shocked. Her whisper comes out a hiss.

                                PRIS
                  Then we're stupid and we'll die.

                                BATTY
                  Not if everybody is doing their job
                  here at home.  How are things at home ?

        Pris doesnt answer, as they hear Sebastian coming out of
        the kitchen.

                                PRIS
                  What if he won't co-operate ?

                                BATTY
                  Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants to
                  be appreciated. We'll appreciate him
                  and he'll co-operate.

        Sebastian walks into the room with a tray.  He takes some
        eggs and puts them into a glass flask full of bubbling
        water that is standing on a retort stand over a bunsen
        burner on his work bench.
        He notices the move on the chess set.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  No.  The Knight takes the Queen, see ?
                  It won't do.

        He takes the White Queen with the Black Knight.

        Batty smiles a smile totally without feeling or interest.

        Sebastian stares at Batty for a long moment, then at Pris.

                                BATTY
                  Why are you staring at us ?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  You're just so... so different.

        Batty nods his head smiling, sending home the fact and
        Sebastian is certainly getting it.

                                BATTY
                  What Sebastian ?

        A long pause.

                                PRIS
                  What makes you think so, Sebastian?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Well, you're ....so perfect.

        Sebastian is grinning from ear to ear.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  What generation are you ?

                                BATTY
                  Nexus 6.

        Sebastian whistles.

        To the couch. Batty couldn't be more pleased.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I know because I do genetic design work
                  for the Tyrell Corporation.
                         (proudly)
                  There's some of me in you !

                                BATTY
                  We have a lot in common.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  What do you mean ?

                                BATTY
                  We have similar problems.
                  Accelerated decrepitude.
                         (or)
                  Like the fabled salmon we came home to die.
                  But we don't want to die quite yet.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Of course not...... Could you....

        His voice is trembling.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Show me something.

                                BATTY
                  Like what ?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Like... anything?

        Like a million things, but he's too excited to think
        of one.

                                BATTY
                  We're not computers, Sebastian, we're
                  physical.

        Pris perks up proudly.

                                PRIS
                  I think, therefore I am.

                                BATTY
                  Very good Pris.  Now show him why.

        Without a moment's hesitation, Pris walks over to the
        flask, sticks her hands into the boiling water and pulls
        out one of the eggs and hands it to Sebastian.

        Sebastian is riveted, his eyes wide and astounded, like
        he's just seen the devil. He laughs nervously, glad that
        the devil is a friend.   Then drops the egg which is
        suddenly burning his hand.

                                BATTY
                  You could help us.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I don't know much about biomechanics
                  Roy, I wish I did, but you're out of
                  my league.

                                BATTY
                  If we don't find help soon, Pris
                  hasn't got long to live.

        Batty walks back to the chess set.

                                BATTY
                  Is he good ?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Who?

                                BATTY
                  Your opponent.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  Dr. Tyrell....  More than brilliant.
                  He's a genius.  He's the Einstein
                  of genetics.

                                BATTY
                  Maybe he can help us, Sebastian.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I'd be happy to mention it to him.

                                BATTY
                  Be better if I could talk to him in
                  person.  But he's not an easy man to
                  get to.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  No.

        Batty leans forward and looks right into Sebastian's eyes.

                                BATTY
                  Will you help us ?

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I....I.. can't.

        He gets up and walks slowly over to Pris.

                                PRIS
                  We really need you Sebastian, you're
                  our best and only friend.

        A smile begins to spread across Sebastian's face.  She
        is irresistable. He sits there for a long moment enjoying
        her embrace.

        Batty leans back nodding in gratitude.

                                BATTY
                  I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.
                  What do you thin, Pris ?

                                PRIS
                  I don't think there's another human
                  being in this whole world who would
                  have helped us.

        Pris gives Sebastian a big kiss.


        INT. HOSPITAL (DAY)

        A horrid image!  Tight on Holden very tight.  His eyes
        are bulging almost out of his head.  Tears streaming
        down his face, spittle spraying from his mouth as he
        wheezes and grimace in horrid convulsions. Haw haw haw.
        We're going to figure out that he's laughing, but only
        after a moment, after we pull back wide enough to see
        he's still engulfed in the breather and necklaced with
        blinking lights, one of which blinks particularly
        violently with every wheeze.

                                HOLDEN
                  Cut it... ha, ah, ah.. cut it a haw,
                  ah ah... cut it out.. Deckard.
                  You're... ah... making me... peeeee.
                  Looka the... ah, haw, light...
                  you're making me piss, you... ass
                  hole.

        Deckard looks uncomfortable and horrified.

                                DECKARD
                  Sorry.

                                HOLDEN
                  Eeeeeeee... haw, ahw, ha.  Hee...
                  he... Hit you with a... ah.  Ah.
                  Snake... Oh Jesus!  Aaaah.  Stark
                  ... Stark naked... Ah, ah oh ah...
                  I love it.

                                DECKARD
                  I thought you'd go for the part
                  about the big guy... Leon.

        Holden's eyes change mood immediately at the thought
        of Leon but the laughter has to continue like a wind-
        up toy running down.  Finally he can talk again.

                                HOLDEN
                  You aired him... what's funny
                  about that?

                                DECKARD
                  Revenge.  I thought you'd...

        Holden interrupts, no longer amused.

                                HOLDEN
                  You don't revenge a machine,
                  asshole!  Your slicer cuts your
                  finger, whaddya do?  Punish it?

        Holden looks at Deckard and lets his wisdom sink in.

                                HOLDEN
                  You can't make a 'thing' feel
                  sorry, Deck.

                                DECKARD
                  They're different, the new ones.
                  That big one... he... it had
                  feelings.

        Holden glares at Deckard for a long moment.

                                HOLDEN
                  Whatja do?  Fuck it?

                                DECKARD
                  Huh?  Wh-what?  Who who?

        Deckard is alarmed.  The secret is out.

                                HOLDEN
                  The tit job, the one with the
                  snake.  You stuck it in, didn't
                  ya?

        Deckard is immensely relieved and confused.

                                DECKARD
                  Uh... no... I mean... uh.

                                HOLDEN
                  You made zig zig, then you aired
                  her out, now you got conscience,
                  right?

        Deckard is smug, sure of himself.  He knows the score.
        As he pontificates we CUT and suddenly we are seeing
        him on a TV screen.

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. BRYANT'S OFFICE - DAY

        A TV monitor FILLS THE SCREEN.  Holden is continuing to
        lecture Deckard on the TV screen.

                                HOLDEN
                  You got the feelings, pal, not her.
                  You fucked a washing machine...
                  then you switched it off.  So what?
                  You cry when you turn the lights
                  out at night?

        Now we see Bryant.  He's sitting in a chair chewing a
        big cigar and glaring at the screen.

                                BRYANT
                  It's pitiful is what it is.  A
                  couple of old blade runners trying
                  to grapple with metaphysics... You
                  gonna turn out that way, Gaff?

                                GAFF
                  I piss on metaphysics.  My middle
                  name is 'death.'  See this foot...
                         (holds up his foot)
                  ... completely lethal!  Savate!
                  French foot fighting.  See these
                  hands...!

        Bryant interrupts the display, unimpressed.

                                BRYANT
                  You think he knows where she is?

                                GAFF
                         (shrugs)
                  Maybe.  Maybe not.  Deckard's a
                  deep one.  You gimmee the
                  promotion, maybe I'll find her.
                  If I get a promotion...

                                BRYANT
                  Shut up!

        Bryant is looking back at the screen, intensely inter-
        ested.

        On the screen Holden is wheezingly explaining something
        to Deckard.

                                HOLDEN
                  ... then they bust into the record
                  room at the Tyrell Corp... that
                  doesn't work!  They put that big
                  bozo... whatsitsname...

                                DECKARD
                  Leon.

                                HOLDEN
                  ... they put him in to infiltrate
                  Tyrell Corp... that doesn't work!
                  They go after that eye designer,
                  the Chinaman...

                                DECKARD
                  Chew.

                                HOLDEN
                  ... that doesn't work!

        Bryant is all attentiion, staring at the screen in
        suspense.

        Gaff is watching, too.

                                DECKARD
                  Work!  Whaddaya mean 'work.'

                                HOLDEN
                  Don't you see what they're after,
                  who they're looking for?

        On the screen Deckard frowns and shakes his head.

                                DECKARD
                  No.  Who?

        Bryant is on the edge of his seat.

                                HOLDEN
                  God!

        Bryant stares at the screen dumbfounded.  Then his jaw
        sags open in disbelief.

                                BRYANT
                  God!

        Gaff shakes his head, smirking.

                                GAFF
                  Metaphysics.

                                BRYANT
                  God?

        Bryant looks about to erupt.

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. DECKARD'S CAR

        All we see at first is the Esper screen which features
        the strangest face ever seen.. it's lines are weirdly
        oscillating and the face itself is strangely anonymous
        and flickering. It is in fact thousands of faces flashing
        on the screen sequentially at the rate of fifty per
        second.

        Deckard is watching the screen.

        A bunch of dwarfs run past the car.


        INT. DECKARD'S CAR

        Deckard is in the dark, suddenly a spinner appears, flashing
        lights across Deckard's Face.

        The Dwarfs run away.
        A PA System blares out.

                                SPINNER
                  This sector was closed to ground traffic
                  10 minutes ago.  What are you doing here ?

                                DECKARD (on intercom to Spinner)
                  Working.  What are you doing ?

                                SPINNER
                  Don't be a smart ass.

                                DECKARD
                  This is Deckard.  Blade Runner. I'm
                  filed and monitored.

                                SPINNER
                  Hold on... checking.....

        Deckard punches up.

                                SPINNER
                  Alright you're clear.  Keep up the
                  good work.

        Deckard punches a number of vid-phone.  Waits.

        On the VIDPHONE screen (not the Esper Screen) Dr. Schlecht
        suddenly appears, answering the call.

                                DR. SCHLECHT
                  Guten Abend.

                                DECKARD
                  Dr. Hermann Schlecht..

                                DR. SCHLECHT
                  Ja.

        Deckard has shoved his badge in front of the lens.

        Schlecht squints, inspecting the badge that must be appearing
        on his vid screen.

                                DECKARD
                  You are Senior Vice President
                  of the Tyrell Corporation.

        Dr. Schlecht nods.

                                DECKARD
                  You have dix huit clearance at
                  Tyrell.   Right ?

                                DR. SCHLECHT.
                  Yes.

                                DECKARD
                  How many other employees have the
                  same clearance.

                                DR. SCHLECHT
                  Four, including Dr. Tyrell and
                  myself.

                                DECKARD
                  The others ?

                                SCHLECHT
                  Dr. Chew and J.F. Sebastian

                                DECKARD
                  Sebastian ?

                                SCHLECHT
                  Yes. J.F. Sebastian.

                                DECKARD
                  I want you to authorise access to
                  your personnel files.  Put it on
                  Esper.

                                SCHLECHT
                  Now ?  Do you know what time it is ?

                                DECKARD
                  J.F.  Sebastian employment and
                  personal information.

                                SCHLECHT

        Deckard punches Schlecht out and punches in Esper.

                  Coming in.  Night Doc.


        INT. DECKARD'S CAR

        The Esper screen reveals a single face SEBASTIAN.

        Information and data blare out.

                  Clearance.....

        Deckard punches the telephone number on the vid phone.

        On the vid-phone a strange out of focus face looks startled.
        It's Pris.

                                DECKARD
                  Hi.... J.F. there ?

                                PRIS
                  Who's this ?

                                DECKARD
                  An old friend of his.

        Pris looks for a moment then puts down the phone.

                               DECKARD
                  That's no way to treat a friend.

        As the vid phone goes blank one of the dwarfs jumps on
        to the hood of Deckard's car.

        Deckard starts up the car, screetches forward and the dwarf
        falls off onto the street.


        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT

        On the vid screen is an off kilter shot of Deckard looking
        surprised.

        Deckard punches the vid screen. It is bright again with
        playback. Pris out of focus, weirdly framed, staring into
        the lens. Then it disconnects.

        Instantly  Deckard replays it again, slows the image
        Pris frozen out of focus.

        The huge pyramid looms over the industrial landscape
        backed by a gorgeous sunset sky of polluted reds.

        Looking closer, we can see an elevator gliding up the
        steep slope of the pyramid toward the apex.

        INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

        Sebastian and Batty are in the elevator, numbers flashing
        on their faces as they shoot up toward the 800th floor.

        Sebastian looks uneasy.

        Suddenly the elevator comes to an abrupt halt, lights
        flash a buzzer sounds and a VOICE emanates from a speaker.

                                SPEAKER
                  Quinzieme Bleu... cinquante.
                  You have six seconds. Counting!
                  Uno.. due... tre...

        Sebastian is frantically fumbling through a stack of
        magnetic cards he's pulled from his pocket, as the counting
        goes on simultaneously in six languages.

        batty is watching Sebastian fumble with the cards.

                                SPEAKER
                  ... cuatro.. quince.... seis......

        Batty reaches out impatiently and takes a card, inserts it.

        The voice stops, the lights go out, the elevator starts up
        again.

        Sebastian gives Batty a funny look.

        The Speaker voice interrupts again.

                                SPEAKER
                  Seven hundred up.... Tyrell Corporation.

        Tyrell is frowning, gets out of bed and walks to his board.

                                TYRELL
                  Ridiculous.  Knight takes Queen.
                  Ha!   Tell him to go home.

        Batty's eyes glow.  A long pause.

        Suddenly the doors of the elevator opens.

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. TYRELL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

        Tyrell is standing at the chess board in his nightgown
        staring at the pieces in a fit of concentration.  He
        doesn't look up at the sound of footsteps.

                                SEBASTIAN
                  I....uh.... I brought a friend.

        Tyrell looks alarmed.

        Batty is standing in the shadows.

        Tyrell is reaching for a tasseled bell pull that hangs
        over his bed.

        Batty's eyes are like little coals glowing.

        Warned by the look, Tyrell abandons the bell pull and
        reaches under the sheets for something.

                                BATTY
                  To act without understanding
                  could lead to the very thing
                  the act seeks to avoid.

        What's in Batty's eyes completes the warning.

        Tyrell decides to heed it.  If he's scared though, he
        does a good job of concealing it.

                                TYRELL
                  I'm surprised you didn't come
                  here sooner.

        Batty moves closer to the bed and the dogs slink away,
        scared toothless.

                                BATTY
                  It's not an easy thing to meet
                  your Maker.

                                TYRELL
                  And what can He do for you?

        Batty sits on the end of Tyrell's bed.

                                BATTY
                  Can the Maker repair what He makes?

                                TYRELL
                  Would you like to be modified?

                                BATTY
                  Had mind something a little more
                  radical.

                                TYRELL
                  What's the problem?

                                BATTY
                  Death.

                                TYRELL
                  I'm afraid that's a little out of
                  my...

        Batty leans close across the sheets and cuts in in an
        urgent whisper.

                                BATTY
                  I want more life, fucker.

        Sebastain looks alarmed.

        Tyrell faces Batty with admirable cool.  After a tense
        pause, the old man slides away from Batty and out of
        bed.  He's wearing a long night shirt and he looks a
        little silly.  He looks down at Batty who's still sit-
        ting on the bed and addresses him as a professor add-
        resses a pupil.

                                TYRELL
                  The facts of life.  I'll be blunt.
                  To make an alteration in the
                  evolvement of an organic life
                  system, at least by men, makers
                  or not, is fatal.  A coding
                  sequence can't be revised once
                  it's established.

                                BATTY
                  Why?

                                TYRELL
                  Because by the second day of
                  incubation any cells that have
                  undergone reversion mutation
                  give rise to revertant colonies --
                  like rats leaving a sinking ship.
                  The ship sinks.

                                BATTY
                  What about E.M.S. recombination?

                                TYRELL
                  We've already tried it -- ethyl
                  methane sulfonate is an alkylating
                  agent and a potent mutagen -- it
                  created a virus so lethal the
                  subject was destroyed before we
                  left the table.

        Tyrell doesn't notice the subtle flicker of suspicion
        on Batty's face... like maybe Batty's not buying all
        this.

                                BATTY
                  Then a repressor protein that
                  blocks the operating cells.

                                TYRELL
                  Wouldn't obstruct replication,
                  but it does give rise to an error
                  in replication so that the newly
                  formed DNA strand carries a
                  mutation and you've got a virus
                  again... but all this is academic...
                  you are made as well as we could
                  make you.

                                BATTY
                  But not to last?

        Batty's expression doesn't reveal whether Tyrell has
        allayed his suspicions as Tyrell approaches Batty
        (sitting on the edge of the bed) and puts a fatherly
        hand on Batty's shoulder.

                                TYRELL
                  The light that burns twice as
                  bright burns half as long.  And
                  you have burned so very, very
                  brightly, Roy.

        Batty looks up at "Father" Tyrell, Tyrell is swelling
        with pride.

                                TYRELL
                  The best of all possible replicants.
                  We're proud of our prodigal son...
                  glad you've returned.  You're quite
                  a prize.

        Batty looks down in a sudden, uncharacteristically
        humble posture and speaks with guilt in his voice.

                                BATTY
                  I've done questionable things.

                                TYRELL
                  Also extraordinary things. --

                                BATTY
                  Nothing the God of bio-mechanics
                  wouldn't let you in heaven for.

        Tyrell in a burst of camaraderie, decides to give
        laughing a try and comes out with a little titter.
        After all, Roy Batty, that swell replicant is about
        to embrace him.  Everything's gonna be okay after all.
        Batty gets up from the bed and puts his hands around
        Tyrell's face.

        CRACK!  Tyrell's skull cracks like dry wood.

        Sebastian stares in horror.

        SQUISH!   Batty squashes the head in a gruesome moment.

        Tyrell slumps to the floor like empty clothes.

        Batty looks at the remains with disgust.

                                BATTY
                  Revertant colonies!  Methane sulfate!
                  Bright lights!

        Batty turns to Sebastian.

        Sebastian looks like a heart attack.

        Batty's eyes glow with fury.

        Sebastian cowers.

        Batty is alone, solemn.  The numbers reflect on his face.

        Deckard pulls his blaster out.

                  Mr. Sebastian?

        No answer. His voice echoes in the emptiness.

        Deckard walks across the dark lobby, stepping around the
        heaps of trash, his footfalls echoing noisily in the silence.

        Cautiously he begins to climb, blaster ready.

        The noises continue.

        blaster ready.


        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

        A shadowy hallway cluttered with debris.. spooky.

        Nothing moves.

        Then we catch the sight of something. Deckard !  He enters
        the hallway, pressed flat against a wall , weapon up.

        Very carefully he slides along the wall.

        We can see a doorway ahead of him, the door to Sebastian's
        apartment.

        He moves to the door. It's open a crack. He peeks in.

        The apartment seems empty.


        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

        Deckard inches the door open, blaster ready.  He looks
        around warily studying the apartment.  He sees nothing
        moving.

        He levels his blaster, arm extended full out cop-style,
        as he ventures deeper into the apartment.

        Suddenly a noise behind him makes him spin, blaster pointed.

        A mouse runs across the floor.

        Deep breath.

        WHUMP!  Pris drops on Deckard from above and wraps her
        bare thighs around his neck as she takes him down.

        Deckard finds himself choking ot death in bare thighs
        as she applies a brutal scissors grip with her legs.
        All he can do is bite at the flesh near her crotch as
        he fights for air and life.

        Pris might look like a punk waif but she's a powerful
        replicant and Deckard is
        falls from his hand as he writhes and
        his body.

        Finally he gets his head loose and gasps for air but
        she is immediately sitting on his chest and he looks up
        into her furious face and flailing fists.

        Deckard grabs at her trying to fight her off, tears
        her tank top loose, exposing one breast, but a lot of
        good that does him.

        Pris starts to choke Deckard with one hand and Deckard's
        only hope is to grasp blindly for his blaster on the floor.

        His hand paws wildly... he can't look... in the general
        area, and when he feels it he grabs it.  He struggles
        to point it at her.

                                DECKARD
                  Please!  I don't want...

        She catches his gun wrist and he fires a shot widly.

        BOW!  Masonry erupts on the ceiling.

        Dekcard struggles to point the weapon but she has his
        wrist in her replicant grip.

                                DECKARD
                  Please!  I don't want to kill you.

        Fat chance!  It doesn't look like he could if he wanted
        to.  She's choking him with one hand, squeezing the
        weapon loose with the other.

        Deckard, fighting for breath and life, gives a violent
        wrench and manages to bring the weapon to bear just
        long enough to squeeze off one shot.

        BOW!  Pris's left arm is torn away at the shoulder.

        Pris's face erupts in fury as she clutches at the
        empty socket.

        Deckard rolls free and tries to cover her.

                                DECKARD
                  Please!  I...

        WHAP!  She kicks him in the chest and he flies back
        into a wall.

        She's advancing on him, kicking like some martial arts
        master... WHAP! WHAP! WHAP!

        Deckard has to shoot or be kicked to death, he's already
        badly battered by her furious feet.

        BOW!  BOW!  Pris is blown away
        hits.

        BOW!  The third hit catches her in the back of the neck
        as she spins away from Deckard... and that's it, she
        goes down in a limp heap, leaving Deckard standing there,
        bloody and stupified.

        He's still staring when he hears it... the drone of the
        elevator ascending.

        Deckard frowns.  He starts toward the door, reaching in his
        pocket as he goes and pulling out a cassette.


        INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

        Deckard slams the cassette into his blaster as he steps
        intop the corridor and looks toward the sound.

        He sees the elevator coming up.... glowing.

        Deckard doesn't like this.  He glances quickly as the
        various possible routes for escpe.

        Not the stairs.

        Nothing else.

        The lift is almost to Sebastian's floor.

        Deckard retreats hastily into Sebastian's apartment.

                                                   CUT TO


        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

        Deckard steps into the room with Pris' body in it.

        He hears the elevator stop.  Then footsteps.

        Deckard considers.

        The footsteps are getting closer.

        Deckard walks silently toward the other door leading into the
        next room and steps through it.

        The footsteps keep coming.

        And the breathing has started. Asthmatic, rasping.

                                                   CUT TO


        INT. BILLIARD ROOM - NIGHT

        Deckard slides around the door and puts his back to the wall,
        blaster ready.


        INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT NIGHT

        Deckard comes running into the lobby (hand held)through
        the billiard room and into the darkened area the other
        side of the billiard room and stands breathing heavily
        gun aimed towards the lobby.


        INT. LOBBY - NIGHT 

        Batty's shadow appears in the doorway (Deckard's POV) he
        stares at Pris' dead body.

        His body walks into the shadow.

        Deckard fires, but Batty is faster, he ducks back and
        disappears.

        Deckard's bullet smashes into the dresser in the bedroom,
        the mirror explodes.

        Deckard runs into the billiard room.


        INT. BILLIARD ROOM - NIGHT

        He ducks back behind the wall.

        Suddenly a hand comes tearing through the wall, and pulls
        Deckard's hand through.

        Systematically, Batty breaks two of Deckard's fingers.

                                BATTY
                  For Pris... for Zhora....
                  Proud of yourself little man....

        As Deckard screams, Batty puts the gun back in Deckard's
        broken hand and pushes it back through the hole.

        Batty's head peers through the hole, and Deckards fires at
        him grazing the side of his face and blowing off his ear.

        Deckard starts running (hand held) through the rooms
        looking for an escape.

                                BATTY(OS)
                  Not very sporting to fire on
                  an unarmed opponent. I thought
                  you were supposed to be good...
                  arent you the man.

                                                   CUT TO


        INT. DARK ROOM - NIGHT

        Batty in semi darkness is
        streaming down in his from his wounds.  He starts to daub
        his face with his own blood, like a commanche warrior.
        Then he starts to strip down - a tribal ritual.


        INT. DARKENED ROOM (re-dressed lobby) ARMOIRE - NIGHT

        Deckard runs into the darkened room. Rats scuttle across
        the floor.

        He hears footsteps coming.  There are no other exits.

        He looks at the armoire.  His only escape.

        He runs to a table and with great pain bends his fingers back
        then runs to the armoire and starts to climb it.

        Batty walks into the room looks up at Deckard and starts
        to laugh.

                                BATTY
                  Where are you going ?

        Deckard continues towards the ceiling, the armoire
        starts to tilt, water drips on his head.

        Thunder and lightning erupt.


        INT. FLOOR B - TOILET - NIGHT

        Deckard's head pops up through the floor next to an
        overflowing toilet.

        All of a sudden he too starts to laugh, as he lays down
        on the floor, his laughter becoming hysterical.

        He looks around for some tape and starts to wrap his broken
        fingers.

        Suddenly, with a resounding crash Batty's head comes through
        the marble above the basin.

        Deckard gets up and makes a run for the door at the end of
        the room, as Batty, animal like, starts slurping the water
        out of the basin.

        Deckard pulls and tugs at the door, frantic with fear.

        The other door opens and Batty walks in, as Deckard manages
        to open his door.


        INT. CLOSET - NIGHT

        Two hundred objects (pigeons) burst out of the room into
        Deckard's face as he runs into the closed off room.

        There is no way out except by the
        proceeds to tear down.

                                BATTY
                  Now where are you going?

        Deckard climbs out the window, as Batty watches.


        EXT. ROOF - WINDOW LEDGE - NIGHT

        Deckard slowly eases himself around the window ledge
        and edges his way around to a cornice.

        Batty appears at another window, as Deckard scrambles
        up the cornice and on to the roof, wind and rain hindering
        his climb.


        EXT ROOF - NIGHT

        Wind and rain. Deckard dashes onto the roof and looks
        frantically over his shoulder. Batty isn't in sight yet.
        He looks around desperately. The roof is a desert no
        shelter. Deckard looks across at the next building.

        Suddenly a rooftop door opens and Batty steps out.

        Deckard looks back at the next building. Is it possible ?
        A long jump. But what choice.

        Decision time.  Deckard decides to go.  He runs directly
        towards Batty, turns, pumping like crazy, going for the gap.

                                                   CUT TO


        EXT. THE ROOF - LOW ANGLE - NIGHT

        Looking up from way below, two buildings loom into the
        dark with a gap between them and a tiny figure running
        like hell and... jumping!

        Deckard leaps across the gap, flies through the air...
        almost makes it... catches a cornice on the second
        building... hangs many stories up over the street and we:

                                                   CUT TO:


        EXT. THE SECOND ROOF - NIGHT

        Deckard hangs onto the cornice in the wind and rain.
        One hand is almost useless, the other's strained to
        the limit.  He looks down.  A long, long fall to the
        ground.

        Deckard looks behind him, over his shoulder.

        He can see Batty twenty feet away on the edge of the
        first roof, watching him.

        Deckard is almost sobbing, holding on with everything
        he's got as we:

                                                   CUT TO:


        EXT. THE FIRST ROOF - NIGHT

        Batty stands there watching Deckard hang.

        Batty grins.

        Then one of his hands cramps badly.  He has to work the
        fingers open with effort.

        He looks at Deckard again.

        Batty walks back five yards, sprints quickly, and
        leaps as we:

                                                   CUT TO:


        EXT. ROOF - LOW ANGLE - NIGHT

        From below we see the tiny figure of Batty as he leaps
        easily across the gap between the two looming skyscrapers
        and we:

                                                   CUT TO:


        EXT. SECOND ROOF - NIGHT

        Deckard is hanging there as Batty lands not far from
        Deckard's desperate hands.

        Batty looks down at Deckard.

        Batty grins and takes a seat only a couple of feet
        from Deckard.

        Deckard's bad hand lets go.  He's hanging by one hand.

        The street looms way below.

        Deckard looks desperately into Batty's cold eyes.

        Batty grins and shakes his head at the absurdity of it.

        Deckard looks into that awful smile and sees no hope
        there.

        Batty glances down at his own hand.  Spasms again.

        Deckard's hand is going.  He knows it's over now, he
        bites the bullet of his anger.  He glares at Batty as
        his grip gives way.

                                DECKARD
                  Asshole!

        Batty meets Deckard's angry eyes.

        Deckard's hand continues to slip.

        Batty is still looking at Deckard's rage.  It moves the
        warrior in him, you can see Batty change his opinion.

        Too late!  Deckard's hand goes.

        Batty's hand is like lightning.  He catches Deckard's
        hand and holds Deckard.

        Deckard is suspended above the awesome drop, not sure
        why he's not falling.  He opens his tightly closed eyes
        and looks up.

        He looks up into the stern warrior face of Batty, the
        cold eyes!

        Deckard hangs there and for a moment he has to consider
        whether this is the continuation of a cruel game.

        The Batty is hauling him up one-handed and with that
        scary strength he has.

        Deckard is pulled onto the roof where he lies on his
        stomach gasping for breath, not moving, just feeling
        something solid under him.

        Batty looks at the man gasping next to him with the
        cold eyes of a man looking at a fish.  It is as though
        Deckard is some species far below Batty on the evolu-
        tionary scale.

        Batty's hand cramps again.

        Batty looks at it, almost with curiosity.

                                                   JUMP CUT TO:


        EXT. THE SECOND ROOF (LATER)

        Deckard is looking at Batty.

        Batty is partly crumpled, frozen in an unnatural posi-
        tion as though he had been writhing and stopped mid-
        writhe.  He looks back at Deckard with eyes full of
        life and intensity.

        They stare at each other for a long time in silence,
        communicating something with their eyes... without
        expression.  Finally Batty breaks the silence.

                                BATTY
                  I've seen things...
                         (long pause)
                  seen things you little people
                  wouldn't believe... Attack ships
                  on fire off the shoulder of Orion
                  bright as magnesium... I rode on
                  the back decks of a blinker and
                  watched c-beams glitter in the dark
                  near the Tanhauser Gate.
                         (pause)
                  all those moments... they'll be gone.

        Batty holds Deckard's eyes like a hypnotist.

                                                   CUT TO:


        EXT. THE SECOND ROOF (A LITTLE LATER)

        Batty is crumpled in a different position.  It's light-
        er now and Batty's eyes are staring into infinity...
        almost lifelessly.  A pigeon flutters down and perches
        on his shoulder.  Batty doesn't stir.

        Deckard is watching motionless.

        The pigeon flies off.

        Batty doesn't move.  Alive or dead?

                                                   CUT TO:


        EXT. THE SECOND ROOF - DAWN

        A more distant perspective.  Deckard is a small figure
        looking down at the dead body of Batty.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  I watched him die all night.  It
                  was a long, slow thing and he
                  fought it all the way.  He never
                  whimpered and he never quit.  He
                  took all the time he had... as
                  though he loved life very much...
                  every second of it... even the
                  pain.  Then he was dead.


        EXT. ROOF - DAWN

        The city is down there.  Endless and gray in the first
        light.

        Deckard's at the edge of the roof.

        Maybe someday he'll be better.  But right now he hasn't
        even got the energy to be sick.

        The Mexican's voice doesn't surprise him, it comes through
        the silence like the rasping of raven's wings.

                                GAFF
                  How do you rate yourself, now Deckard ?

        He is standing 20 feet away, on the edge of the roof, like
        a captain looking at the sea.  Smarts as a rooster,he places
        a foot on the buttress....

                                GAFF
                  You put on quite a show - no doubt
                  about it...

        With a flourish he brings a dirty rag out of his pocket and
        starts polishing the pointed tip of his long black shoe.

                                GAFF
                  You think I'm a wimp - don't you.

        He waits for the answer.  But Deckard doesn't bother.

        Gaff moistens the rag with his tongue and applies it to
        the toe.

                                GAFF
                  I could kill you right now -
                  so you better say something.

        Deckard is unarmed. Gaff's got all the aces- seems to be
        bristling with concealed weapons.  Deckard's eyes level on
        him.  His voice comes out low and raw.

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah. I think you're a wimp.

        Gaff nods like he knew it all along - it seems to please
        him.

                                GAFF
                  I admire you more and more.

        Deckard exhales fatigue.  His eyes close. The bullshit
        is endless.  Gaff smiles like a beaver. Puts the rag back
        in his pocket.

                                GAFF
                  I guess you're through, huh.

        Deckard doesn't answer.

                                GAFF
                  Washed up. Wiped out.   Finished.

        He cocks his head like a bluejay waiting for the answer.

                                GAFF
                  What about it.

                                DECKARD
                  Yeah. I'm through.

        Somewhere far away a whistle blows. Then silence. Deckard
        turns.  He is moving away.  His back to the Mexican. Gaff's
        voice follows him. Taunting.

                                GAFF
                  You did
                  sure you are, man.

        He snickers. His hand comes out of his pocket with a gun.

                                GAFF
                  It's hard to be sure who's who around
                  here.

        Deckard keeps walking.

                                GAFF
                  Carnall!

        Deckard slowly turns.

        Gaff shows him the gun. But it doesn't make any difference.

                                GAFF
                  Oye la agua.

        Deckard stares. He doesn't know the words.

        Ever the dandy, Gaff swaggers closer, stops.

                                GAFF
                  Here.

        He throws the gun across the gap to Deckard.

        Deckard doesn't try to catch it. It lands at his feet.

        Gaff dismisses the rejection with a suck on his teeth.

                                GAFF
                  I wouldn't wait too long. I wouldn't
                  fool around. I'd get my little panocha
                  and get the hell outta here.

        They just stare at each other. Gaff smiles.

                                GAFF
                  It's too bad, she don't last, eh!

        The smile is real and a little sad.

                                GAFF
                  But who does.

        Everybody knows the answer to that one.

        The Mexican shrugs.

        The light is brighter.

        The gun gleams on the wet

        Deckard turns and walks.

                                                   CUT TO



        INT. DECKARD'S CORRIDOR - DAY

        Deckard's FEET CLICK along the corridor as he
        approaches his door.

        Near the door, on the floor, is a little tinfoil uni-
        corn, the kind of sculpture Gaff has been crafting on
        previous occasions.

        Deckard comes to the door, unlocks it, opens it.

        He doesn't see the piece of sculpture on the floor.

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. DECKARD'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

        The room is dark and quiet as Deckard enters.  You can
        hear the SOUND OF A BABY CRYING somewhere.

        Deckard frowns, looks around.

        The CLOCK TICKS.  The BABY CRIES.  Nothing moves.

                                DECKARD
                  Rachael.

        No answer.

        Deckard looks concerned.  He glances in the kitchen.

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. KITCHEN - DECKARD'S POV - DAY

        He sees the same old mess.

        Or did she clean it up?

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. BEDROOM - DAY

        The bedroom is dark.

        Deckard opens the door.

        He sees something on the bed.  Motionless.  A body?

        Deckard enters.

        The CLOCK TICKS.  The BABY SQUALLS in the distance.

        Deckard goes close.

        Rachael is on the bed.  Completely motionless.

        Deckard leans over her, very close, to see if she's
        breathing.

        A long moment.

        Then the tension goes out of him.  She's alive.  He
        turns away from her with a new urgency.

        He pulls the blaster from his holster and goes to the
        dresser.  He opens a drawer and pulls out a box of
        ammo.  Opens it.

        KACHUK!  He slams a cartridge in the gun.

        KACHUK!  Another.

        On the bed Rachael stirs, opens her eyes.  KACHUK!

        She sees an ominous sight.  Deckard is loading his gun
        in the shadows near the dresser, his back to her.

        KACHUK!  He slams the last cartridge in.

                                DECKARD
                  Do you love me?

        He is looking at her in the mirror on the dresser.  He
        has the gun in his hand.

        She is looking at his back.

                                RACHAEL
                  I love you.

        Deckard holsters the gun without turning and pulls
        open another drawer.

                                DECKARD
                  Do you trust me?

        Deckard is pulling clothes out of the drawer, stuff-
        ing them hastily into a parachute bag.

                                RACHAEL
                  I trust you.

        Deckard turns and looks at her, one hand full of
        clothes, the other hand holding the parachute bag.

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

        The door opens and Deckard and Rachael step out.  They
        are carrying a couple of overnight cases.

        Rachael starts toward the elevator.

        Deckard locks the door and turns to follow her.

        He spots something on the floor, something small.

        He reaches down and picks it up.

        It's the tiny unicorn made of tinfoil... Gaff's
        gauntlet.

        Deckard looks at it for a moment.

                                                   CUT TO:


        EXT. MOVING TREES - DAY

        Birch trees whip past at 160 miles per hour urged on
        by big, nasty MUSIC.

        We have the feeling we are going to see a unicorn.

        Instead we see Deckard's car rocketing through the
        woods.

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. DECKARD'S CAR - DAY 

        Deckard is at the wheel, Rachael is beside him.

        Deckard smiles at her.

        Rachael smiles back tentatively.

        Deckard glances back at the road, then at the vid
        screen.

        A little blip flashes on the screen.

        Deckard notices it, his eyes narrow just a little.  He
        reaches in his pocket, pulls out the unicorn.

        Deckard puts the tinfoil unicorn on the dash.

        A flicker of a smile crosses his face.

                                                   CUT TO:


        EXT. WOODS - DAY

        Deckard's car bullets through the woods in a fury of
        speed and MUSIC.

        We BACK OFF IT AND UP, PAST whizzing branches, OVER
        the treetops, losing the car as we SOAR over what is
        suddenly a vast forest spreading to infinity.

        Enormous MUSIC!

        Deckard's voice over.

                                DECKARD (V.O.)
                  I knew it on the roof that night.
                  We were brothers, Roy Batty and I!
                  Combat models of the highest order.
                  We had fought in wars not yet
                  dreamed of... in vast nightmares
                  still unnamed.  We were the new
                  people... Roy and me and Rachael!
                  We were made for this world.  It
                  was ours!

        Trees explode PAST US in a rage of branches as we DIP
        and SWERVE and that's when the spinner looms INTO VIEW
        zooming RIGHT AT US, then tilting and yawing off in
        hot pursuit with Gaff at the controls.

        CREDITS ARE ROLLING, God help us all!

                                                   FADE OUT.


                              THE END
